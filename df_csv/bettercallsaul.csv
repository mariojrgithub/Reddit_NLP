Jimmy threatens the ""sanctity"" of the law, and he's not a real lawyer. At first I thought maybe he's just kind of virtue signaling but it seems like he's too obsessed with the idea of the law. Like no one is that pure and noble in their intentions. No one is really that interested in keeping the integrity of an idea. It's like those pundits or politicians who always espouse how great ""America"" is, its strange for someone to have that much personal investment in a concept. It makes me think that ""the law"" represents something else to Chuck.

Out of all the fucked up shit that has happened on both shows, the death of Mike is easily the worst in my view. Such a pointless and stupid waste of life, a murder that had no rhyme or reason behind it beyond the pettiness and shallow, impotent rage of Walt. Mike was fleeing, he was no longer a threat to anyone, and Walt got nothing out of it, not even a momentary satisfaction. 

I have to agree with Jonathan Banks that Mike should have stood his ground at the park and faced the music, abandoning his family was an out-of-character decision. His entire arc in both shows was to provide for his granddaughter and there was no way he would have given up on that mission even at the cost of his own life.

I think there should be a big court case scene, maybe Skyler and Gene both should do some jail time for conspiring and embezzling, and Jesse will be cleared of all charges since theres no proof he killed anybody.

I hope the BB ""movie"" turns into a full season since a single 2hour story will be too short to wrap up all the loose ends. When the movie releases next year, it will just be another episode of the series that takes place in the future ""post-bb"" but it will end with a cliffhanger such as Jesse finding the vacuum repair guy and forcing him to give up Saul/Genes location. This will set us up for another future/post-bb episode the following year after season 6 of BCS.

I know it's been awhile since this episode, but I find it really interesting to think about. In the flashback where Jimmy and Chuck's mom dies, did Chuck not tell Jimmy her last words out of spite or did he do it to protect his brother? 

I personally think Chuck did it out of spite. Chuck's biggest problem with Jimmy has always been that no matter how big of a screw-up Jimmy was, he was always their parents' favorite. Chuck was the good one. He went to law school, went on to become very successful, but he was never appreciated as much as Jimmy, the scam artist little brother who bankrupted the family business and was arrested so many times. Chuck never left his mother's side no matter what and was going to go hungry no matter what. Jimmy couldn't wait for Chuck and left to get sandwiches and when his mother wakes up and calls out for Jimmy and not Chuck before she dies, that absolutely destroyed Chuck. It was no matter how hard he tried, he could never get the same level of appreciation from people as his little brother could.

One could argue that he told Jimmy to protect him, since Jimmy would have live with that guilt for the rest of his life. I totally understand that perspective, but on the other hand, it just seems that because of how bad that hurt Chuck and knowing how jealous he is of his brother for that reason, I took it as he was just so angry at Jimmy for leaving that he didn't want to tell him the truth.

once howard tried affirming that everyone makes mistakes, chuck thinks that Howard thinks hes insane, and not having the sensitivity. Howard questioned his mental health and intellect without taking in consideration this fake sensitivity, so chuck's major spiral downward begins. Chuck's ego was hurt from this incident.

&amp;#x200B;

To make it worse, the chicanery incident completely destroyed his ego, as Jimmy disproves his condition as being physical and shows that it's a mental disorder.

&amp;#x200B;

chuck never wanted to think that there is something mentally wrong with him and thought the sensitivity is something physical that can eventually go away. Once it was confirmed mental, he probably assumed he won't be able to get it out of his head. He believed he will die with it and no one will take him serious ever again.  


  
If he wanted to, he could've retired and took his part of HHM and leave the community as a respected lawyer. This was what Jimmy was trying to push all along, from the first episode.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, he wanted to prove to everyone he is not mentally ill to retain what he think he's lost (respect) so he continuously pushes himself to spend time in the office.  


Howard had too much respect and class to disobey chuck, so he listened to him and let him take an ""extended sabbatical"".  


  
**TL;DR/conclusion**

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, Chuck's  story resembles Walt's a lot, as they both would have had a chance to retire in peace with the respect of everyone around them but instead their ego could not accept it so it led to their miserable downfalls.

* It is more dangerous to walk around with weapon with no serial number on it as it is illegal upon inspection.

* The serial number itself does nothing to identify the buyer in any way as he is certainly not going to register it.

* The only person it can be traced to is the last person that bought it officially, which is likely either the arms dealer himself or his supplier.

61,TheresA_LobsterLoose,2019-06-21 02:04:24,0,11,22,"**Episode 1** with Peter Gould, Bob Odenkirk, Jonathan Banks &amp; Minkie Spiro (director)

In the opening scene with Gene in Omaha, after Gene gets out of the hospital and is in the taxi where the driver seems to have ID'd him... the street that Gene gets out is the same street where Jesse's parents house was. Not in the show, of course, because one scene is in Omaha and the other is Albuquerque. But they've been shooting in Albuquerque for so long, they're starting to have trouble with locations overlapping. So the director was told to avoid shooting that house.

Mike's house (in real life) was probably built in the late 19th century and theres a block out front that's for getting on and off a horse or carriage.

Keri Condon, who plays Mike's daughter in law, was a jockey in Ireland and raced horses.

Mike getting to sit at home, he figured he'd be able to collect a paycheck and watch baseball. But Jonathan Banks said Mike is a Phillies fan and they tanked that year. I'm not sure if we have a definate date for when season 4 takes place, but the worst record I could find for the Phillies for the early-mid 2000's was 2002 when they finished under .500 and 3rd in the division. Every other season in the early 00's, Philly was pretty decent

Jonathan Banks said hes been drinking Pabst out of the refrigerator in that house for years, and if theres any viewers out there who have anything to do with Pabst, he figured ""Those miserable motherfuckers would've sent him a 6 pack at some point"".

**EPISODE 2** with Peter Gould, Patrick Fabian, Michael Mando, Mark Johnson, Thomas Schnauz (writer) &amp; Michelle MacLaren (director)

In the opening scene, we see the doctor that treated Gus in Breaking Bad (in the episode after *Salud*). Originally, they were going to shoot a much larger scene for this episode that showed how Gus originally met the Doctor, at an airport somewhere and how Gus recruited him. But it was deemed ""too big"", so they left that part for offscreen.

Neff Copiers (the copy store with the Hummel figurine) was empty, there was nothing there. The show built a business that looks like it's been there forever. 

Theres a scene in this episode with Kaylee on a swing. It's a direct callback to Breaking Bad 507 *Say my Name*, the episode where Mike sees Kaylee for the last time. They lined up this shot to be the same

Everytime theres a painting on a wall, a tattoo or even graffiti, it has to be cleared by lawyers for rights

This was the episode with Kim's amazing scene in Howard's office. They basically just talked about how amazing she was, nothing we didnt already know. I really wished Rhea had been in this episode so she could've talked about that scene. Patrick Fabian did say they rehearsed it, but it was nothing like when they shot the scene

Theres a lot more in each episode, but those were the highlights. So far, I've liked the commentaries from the earlier seasons better. But that's probably because they had a lot more Vince Gilligan and Michael McKean. Peter Gould is fine in these episodes so far, but Vince Gilligan is by far the best. I'm hoping he's in some of the upcoming episode commentaries. I'm not sure I'm even gonna watch the commentary for episode 3 because none of the main actors are in it.",I'm watching the episode commentaries for Season 4 and thought I'd post some of the more interesting things,22

Saul never explains to walt how he launders money, but we know that sauls money laundering operation is not connected to gus... or is it? I mean saul acts as if he never met gus in breaking bad (even though we know he does meet gus in BCS)

So my theory is that jimmy will somehow come into some ""illegal"" money, and kim will tell him she doesnt want any part of it. But then kim will lose her job with mesa verda (because of the scam she pulled to change the bank building, which will end up violating some building code) and then her and jimmy will be in need of quick cash, so kim will start laundering money through Ice Station Zebra Associates... this will eventually lead her to working for Lydia

Then in the future Gene scenes, gene will find out that Kim was arrested for working at Madrigal and hell have to come out of hiding to save her

109,valsday,2019-06-12 19:42:15,0,5,4,"Of course, when watching the show, we all sympathize with Jimmy and hate Chuck - even if sometimes actually pitying and sympathizing with him when we see how unwell he really is.

But if I'm honest with myself,  I can surely be spiteful and envious of my younger sister. She was always allowed to do anything, prioritized and given countless passes on doing stupid things - spending much more money than the rest of us while not doing much at all, generally being lazy, irresponsible, and acting entitled. (Although there was never any defecating through sun roofs.)

Chuck is poisoned by his envy, ultimately a great mind brought down by years of spite and trying to get back at Jimmy and put him down. I'd argue the fact he couldn't get over it is what drove him insane and ultimately killed him. (Hence the spoiler tag on this post.)

I believe that deep down, these feelings stem from just wanting to be recognized, acknowledged from those closest to you, for being the more responsible, hard-working, sacrificing sibling. Since they don't provide such comfort, and indeed continue excusing the other, subconsciously one tries to make the other look worse; to make their fault more obvious.

If I'm honest, I can see that I'm not the best person I could be if I can't let go of such spite. Sure, it is unfair, but the way to be better is neither to become as entitled as her, nor to try to rid her of that privilege. The only way to grow into a truly conscientious person is to free myself from the burden of this envy; stay humble and hard-working, to do the right thing even if others aren't. I can only control myself and should only be concerned if **I'm** the best **I** can be.

I promise I will, thanks for listening.","It's not easy to admit, but I see I'm more Chuck than Jimmy",4

I noticed this while rewatching with someone who is watching for the first time.  When Chuck finally goes off on his rant to Jimmy on why he was working against him, the line that stuck out the most to me was ""the law is sacred!"".  This, to me anyway, felt like Chuck giving a noble and morally righteous cover for his actual petty insecurity and disdain for his brother.  One of the biggest reasons it got under his skin that Jimmy was becoming a lawyer was that being a lawyer and the stature that came with it was what separated him and gave him a level of esteem he could take pride in.  With Jimmy invading ""his"" space he felt threatened and his own sense of self  worth and superiority was questioned.

Walt:

Walt flips out on Jesse for cooking his own formula without him because ""its an insult to the chemistry"".  He later tells Gus that he is offended he would even want to work with Jesse without walt because ""the chemistry must be respected.""  He gives a similar type of moral cover for his own petty insecurity and ego problems.  He clearly took pride in the fact that it was ""his"" product and the fact that it was being replicated by someone of jesses stature threatened what he felt seperated him and his pride.

Summary:  Jesse encroaching on walts greatness by creating a product of similar quality unsettled his sense of worth and superiority just as Jimmy becoming a laywer did to Chucks.  Both characters tried to mask their egomania and insecurity by using a false moral crying call ""the law is sacred!"" ""the chemistry must be respected""

171,MrFranklin49,2019-05-22 23:12:58,0,8,14,"Undoubtedly, one of the most anticipated Better Call Saul characters was Lalo, as he was first mentioned in Saul's Breaking Bad debut episode. ""Lalo didn't send you? No Lalo?"" I've heard several theories as to who people thought he might be, and ultimately he ended up being another Salamanca cousin, who is just as sadistic and cunning, but has more charisma and charm, unlike Tuco or the Twins. The question is, who did you guys think Lalo was going to be prior to his first appearance? 

Personally, I thought he was going to be Lalo Espinosa. The Espinosa gang was the gang that Nacho framed for Arturo's death and the Cousins completely wiped them all out. I was expecting something to come from this story. I thought maybe Lalo was the lead Espinosa's brother or relative or something and that he was going to learn somehow about Nacho's involvement and essentially blackmail him into working against Gus to avenge his family, which would add further conflict to the Nacho vs. Gus story. That is who I was expecting Lalo to be. I didn't see him being another one of Hector's nephews, but I did like that he was. At the same time, it does kind of confirm that Lalo will die in Better Call Saul considering that Gus tells Hector in Breaking Bad, ""The Salamanca name dies with you."" However, that doesn't matter to me. The journey is beyond exciting and who knows? Maybe Lalo survives somehow and Gus thinks he's dead? I mean who knows. Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould are geniuses and are great at building suspense. 

But what about you guys? Were you expecting Lalo to be a Salamanca? Did you have the same opinion as me and think he was going to be linked to the Espinosas?",Who Did You Guys Think Lalo Was Going To Be At First?,14

204,umnothing,2019-05-17 17:46:49,0,4,20,"It was stated in many interviews about *Better Call Saul* before it aired that it would chronicle Saul Goodman and other characters before, **during**, and after *Breaking Bad*. Obviously these kinds of ideas change as a show goes on and can be tossed by the wayside, and the first four seasons have only taken place prior to *Breaking Bad*. But from what I see here, most of us (including me) are expecting the show to continue into the *Breaking Bad* timeline with at least a few episodes that take place during. 

Unless you joined this sub in the last 5 seconds, you are aware that in Saul’s first episode of *Breaking Bad*, when Walter and Jesse kidnap him and take him to the desert, he is worried that it is at the behest of someone named “Lalo” (obviously a throwaway character line that has been worked into the *Better Call Saul* narrative). And, you probably also know that in season 4 of *Breaking Bad*, Gus menacingly reminds Hector that “the Salamanca name dies with you,” indicating that Lalo, who has been established to be a Salamanca, is dead by this time. Furthermore, in that same scene when listing the names of Salamancas who he has recently killed, Gus does not mention Lalo (or Eduardo, Lalo’s given name) meaning that he most likely died prior to Gus’ mass assassination. Certainly, the writers of *Better Call Saul* are completely aware of all of this and are taking it into account. This makes me wonder if **Lalo and Saul’s feud, whatever it may be, will be the main focus of the Breaking Bad crossover aspect of Better Call Saul** - the midquel part. Saul “takes care of” Lalo in one way or another, with Lalo winding up dead before or during the season 4 period of Breaking bad. 

It would make sense and not be too ham-fisted. Obviously it would be boring to just re-hash all of the stuff that happened in *Breaking Bad*, so there’s got to be something that Saul is doing when he’s not working with Walt and Jesse, something that we didn’t see in *Breaking Bad*. Clearly, Lalo has got Saul shitting bricks by the time he meets Walt, so we know they must meet before then and Saul must do something worth pissing him off. It seems like Saul dealing with Lalo as an enemy would be a beautiful way to overlap the two shows without letting *Breaking Bad* steal the spotlight. 

Saul and Lalo feuding would continue and conclude a major *Better Call Saul* storyline, it’s not contrived, and it could take up most of Saul’s previously-off-screen time in the *Breaking Bad* timeline, as Lalo wouldn’t “need” to be dead (or missing) until nearly the end of season 4. After that, it’s pretty much all about Walt tying up his loose ends, and that would take us to Gene pretty quickly. It also wouldn’t require Walt or Jesse to be in the foreground. It’d be a nice way to keep us entertained without relying on “Look who it is! Walt and Jesse! Wee!” and so far, the creators and writers of this show have been delivering without much, if any, pandering. And while this may seem like an obvious decision, I think it would still be a satisfying one.

Lalo seems, in a way, to be the Gus of *Better Call Saul*: seemingly undefeatable, incredibly powerful, intelligent, scary, and a worthy adversary who can’t be easily duped. If the writers see him in this way as well, pitting him against Saul would be a natural move, making Saul feel the need to kill Lalo before Lalo can do the same to him. And they’ll no doubt come up with some satisfying, unpredictable, and exciting way of killing him off. 

Of course, Lalo could simply be dead before Saul meets Walt, and Saul is merely unaware until afterwards. Maybe Saul set up some plan to kill Lalo and is worried that it backfired or something. Who knows.","Lalo, and Better Call Saul meeting Breaking Bad: a prediction",20

216,severed360,2019-05-13 18:40:54,0,18,113,"S5- opens with a black and white teaser of Gene (as usual) he gets home from work, turns on the tv and he sees on the news about a massive gang shooting in NM, with multiple dead bodies found. Roll intro

Back in the present, Jimmy is setting up his new office as Saul while trying to maintain a healthy relationship with Kim, but Saul will be working with less elderly and more shady clients. Gus is trying to figure out how to finish the superlab, but Lalo is investigating Mike and discovers his connections to Nacho. Then, Kim gets in trouble with her Boss at Mesa Verda after their new construction plans violate some building code, causing her to lose her job so she decides to stop playing cons with Jimmy, and she will tell him “One day you are going to need me and I won’t be there”. Mike talks to Nacho about killing Lalo, but Nacho says they cant do it alone, they call Jimmy but he says he wont help them. So, theres a shootout where Nacho gets shot (again) maybe somebody (krazy8?) gets arrested, and in comes Hank to investigate (Hank might not be working for the DEA yet, maybes hes just a cop)

At this point (late 2020) we could potentially see the BB ""movie"" release. But my hope is that its not actually a movie (like its not a 2hour theater movie) its just like a full/extended episode or 2 of BCS that takes place in the future but with a new title like Breaking Bad: Aftermath (so people know it comes last). Maybe it shows Jesse after he escapes the compound and hes just looking for a safe place to sleep (with some flashbacks to a happier time in his life). Maybe he drives by sauls office which is all shutdown, and searches for Huell/Kuby with the help of Badger. My hope is that this is all just setting up for the final season, and it wont be the last time we see an extended ""future"" (or post-bb) episode like this.

2021

S6- opens with Gene sitting in his living room drinking and acting nervous, hes scanning every news station looking for any details regarding the shooting. He decides to pick up the phone and calls somebody, all we hear him say is ""yea, its me"" but we don't know who he calls.

We see Kim distancing herself from Jimmy, but not entirely. She's just burying her head into pro-bono cases and relying on Jimmy to pay the bills. Hank is getting close to pinning some crimes on Nacho (possibly due to the fact that Domingo/Krazy8 becomes an informant) so Nacho skips town. But nacho wants to bring his Dad and his dad won't listen, so he doesn't go too far since many people know his father. Eventually, Lalo is going to realize that Nacho was involved in Hectors injury, so Gus tells Mike he wants Lalo dead. I imagine a scene where Mike yells at Jimmy blaming him for Nachos death and saying ""youre next!"" (not really, Mikes lying to manipulate him into doing something really bad) so that Jimmy will turn the DEA onto Lalo inorder to get him arrested. Maybe Jimmy plants drugs on Lalo, then Hank gets a promotion? and Nacho is able to live peacefully sorta, but it actually allows Lalo to return in the future

we also need a cameo of this guy [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui8WzX6erH4&amp;t=18s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui8WzX6erH4&amp;t=18s)

Another theory of mine (I know everybody hates this idea and will downvote me for saying something so stupid lol... but) it would be interesting if somehow Kim started working for/with Lydia at Madrigal (not sure why but better than her dying right? lol) also I realize I completely left out Howard, not sure but I assume he will carry on with HHM, or maybe he becomes a meth addict =/ ya never know lol jks... Daniel Wormald should buy a laser tag! oh and somewhere in there Jimmy has to get his payout from the sandpiper case, allowing him to buy his Cadillac. 

S6b- Theres obviously a lot more that can be filled in, because Mike and Gus deserve a big send off for their last appearance onscreen. Or maybe their final scene will be Mike staring at security screens and Gus asking Gale if hes ready to cook (while eating chicken of course...) Eventually well probably see a time jump and then Walter walks into Sauls office. I'd also like to see some more events that take place during BB, giving us a different perspective we may not have previously known/realized, like the DEAs investigation of Madrigal? I don't know if they could do a full season like that so, maybe season6 will get split into 2parts like BBs final season, bringing BCS to about 66 episodes (slightly more than BB but only if you don't include the movie/extra season) both these series need 2 major endings! (one for current main characters, and one for future Gene and Jesse) theres so much more they could do in a few more years from now...

2023?

BB/BCS Extended Finale- I'm hoping they do more than just a 2hour movie for BB, cause it sounds shallow being just about Jesse on the run. I want to see Jesse and Gene reunite after BCS, like there should be a final full season after BCS ends that takes place after BB. Maybe Gene will ask for Kim to help him and he will give himself in to rescue Jesse for his freedom (hes Slippin Jimmy he has to take the fall). Maybe Lalo or Nacho return for one last showdown, and Jesse/Saul has to find walts missing money but Lalo is watching them? There should be a big court case scene involving Madrigal and walts money, with Kim defending Jimmy (and Jesse) one last time in the court of law before Jimmy goes to prison for embezzling and conspiring. Jesse needs to be cleared of all charges to live a normal life, I also want to see a funeral for Hank, and Maybe the final scene will be Jesse and Badger (or Brock?) running a furniture store and (years later) Kim and Jimmy come into buy a crib! And all of that is going to require more than just 2hours, which is why I am hoping the BBmovie rumors turn into a full season named something like Breaking Bad Aftermath (or something more interesting)

When all is said and done, we should be able to watch the series chronologically starting with BCS followed by BB and ending with BBA, or we could watch it in production order (whichever people prefer). Then maybe ina few more years we can get another prequel (miniseries or actual 2hour theater-style movie) starring a young Gus forming his empire in the 80s ?maybe :) the one character we haven't seen enough of is Don Eladio and I want to know more about Madrigal!",Predictions &amp; Theories for BCS series (unofficial spoilers),113

222,MrFranklin49,2019-05-12 16:02:46,0,17,5,"I thought it would be fun to do up a list of some Better Call Saul characters, who are not seen in Breaking Bad, that we could speculate on what their final fates will be by the end of the series. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Kim -** I would call this one a 50-50. I can see her leaving Jimmy due to his dark transformation to Saul, or I can see her dying somehow. Honestly, I have no idea which direction it will go, so I'll say either she leaves or she dies. The scam that her and Jimmy ran to set Huell free I think will come back to bite her and she will get disbarred because of it. This I think will be the last straw, either leading to her departure or her death. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Howard -** I can see Howard surviving the series. I am honestly super intrigued to see what they do with him going forward, as I do not have any idea. But I don't see them killing Howard. Somehow he will survive I think.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Nacho -** I predict Nacho will survive and he will flee the country with his father using the fake ID's that he has in his house. This would be a great way to introduce Robert Forster's disappearer character, as he helps Nacho and his dad change their identities and flee to Canada. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Lalo -** I think Lalo is guaranteed to die. In Season 4 of Breaking Bad, when Gus taunts Hector over the cartel's demise, he says ""The Salamanca name dies with you."" So to me, it's pretty clear that Lalo is dead by the time Breaking Bad starts. I'm thinking Mike will end up killing him, as he becomes too big of a threat to Gus' operation.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Kevin and Paige from Mesa Verde -** They will fire Kim once they learn her involvement in the Huell situation. They will continue their expansion with Rich Schweikart's help. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Werner's remaining men -** That's a good question. Mike did promise Werner before he died that his men would get to go home, but knowing Gus Fring, I'm not sure if he would let them. I can see Mike vouching for them to Gus to honor Werner, but then again, in order for Mike to become the truly hardened badass that we know from Breaking Bad, who was willing to just kill and kill and kill for Gus, I think he will end up killing them himself, further pushing him to becoming deadly hitman Mike. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Rich Schweikart -** He will also fire Kim upon being exposed. He will work with Mesa Verde and pick up where Kim left off. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Ernie -** I'm not sure if we ever will see Ernie again in the series. We haven't seen him since Chuck fired him back in early Season 3 and the only time we saw him after that was the karaoke flashback. I sure hope we see him at some point, just to see what he's up to, but I tend to think he'll be fine.

Personally, this is what I want to happen even though I know it never will.

Gene is in the bathroom, washing his hands, then looks up at the mirror. And behind him is Walter, with the beard and full head of hair from S5E16. Gene turns around, terrified. Walt then turns around and walks away. No words.

Very far-fetched but I think it would be cool! When Walter was going back to ABQ he was a wanted man, so I think it would make sense for him to avoid the major routes and instead going through other places like Omaha.

Since Breaking Bad was from Walt and Jesse anything that Saul did that was unrelated to the meth business didn't need to be shown, so if Saul's cartel issue is to be resolved on BCS it needs to take place after the introduction of Saul on Breaking Bad",I Think Better Call Saul needs to overlap Breaking Bad,10

So Walt's analogy, which is kind of continued to be applied to Jimmy, hits strongly here, the areas of Albuquerque that are bad, are so bad, you need massive metal bars over your windows and door.

That doesn't happen ever in my part of Canada...the most I've ever seen is people having metal bars installed INSIDE behind the windows and usually when they have been robbed and want to please the insurance company and maybe lower premiums. Being free is not easy either, especially in American hoods, it seems. They chose that house on purpose to tell the audience something, they did so a lot in BrBa too, but it was a bit more on the nose, a favourite is the huge SIGNS sign in the laundry parking lot from the next door business when Walt goes to work at the end of season 3, seeing Gale's car and it's recombobinant(sic) bicycle sitting on top of it right under it from the camera's perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

Perspective's a lot similar when Kim knock on her door, making sure we see the huge bars on the house. I really enjoy how Kim developed in season four, getting more empathetic, doing Jimmy's old job in her spare time for the sake of helping people, she's doing what she found noble in Jimmy earlier on, but that she pretends not to see..at least until where we left off.",There's more than one kind of prison...,20

I still think that Howard needs to learn about this somehow. It kind of saddened me in Season 4 that Howard was sidelined and barely got any screentime, which I thought he would with Chuck being gone. However, I think Season 5 will be Patrick Fabian's season, or at least he'll be one of the standouts. Honestly, he stole the show in each scene he had during Season 4, such as his confession about Chuck's suicide, his scene with Kim, the insomnia scene in the bathroom. One of my very few complaints about Season 4 was the lack of Hamlindgo Blue. 

Season 5 will probably bring Howard back into the fold and make him more prominent than ever. I can see it as a Breaking Bad type moment like when Jesse finds out that Walt poisoned Brock and he absolutely loses it; a similar scene when Howard finds out Jimmy indirectly caused Chuck's downfall. I'm not sure how he finds out, whether he goes to the insurance company and learns from the agent herself or what, but he's gotta figure it out somehow. Then, I think we may see a Jimmy vs. Howard arc that could be resolved in the finale with Howard either leaving the show somehow or being killed. Either way, I think Howard will have to find out eventually. Jimmy dumped all of the blame for Chuck's death on Howard, when really Jimmy played a huge factor in it and once Howard learns of this, he will not be happy.

For Jimmy I'd say it's his scam to get Irene to settle the Sandpiper case. All of his previous scams in the show were against people who had either wronged him in some way (Chuck/Kettlemans/Howard) or put him in a situation where he had no other choice (Tuco/Nacho/Clifford Main) but here he actively chose to isolate an old lady to get his Sandpiper money. Surely there could've been a better way to solve his financial problem. The fact that he almost got away with this scam probably also played a role in his desire to steal the hummel figurine in the next season. He was now comfortable pulling scams on people who were innocent and uninvolved with him.

Sure, he was an asshole for constantly trying to spoil Jimmy's career, and that was awful. But being impartial here, Jimmy falsified Chuck's documents with Mesa Verde, and nothing could justify that. Jimmy had a good hearth, but as Chuck said once ""he can't help himself"". I've seen in this sub that some blame Chuck on Jimmy becoming Saul, but I don't think so. Jimmy was who he was (he himself says that Chuck was the one who kept him from doing wrong things, and if you need someone as a support for being honest, then you're not honest in reality). He got an incredibly good job at Davis and Main, it was his chance to make things right and he totally ruined it, and that had nothing to do with Chuck. He just wasn't honest, he only succedes when he starts to be himself. 
What Jimmy did with Davies and Main kinda explains very well why Chuck wouldn't take his brother in his own buffet. Maybe he saw that kind of things coming if he accepted him, and that's the same reason why Kim wouldn't start a law partnership with him. When one learns in s1 what Chuck did to prevent Jimmy from entering HHM, you hate Chuck, and sure it was a very very very shitty thing to do. But seeing how he behaves in the future makes it a little more understandable. Who would want an associate like Jimmy if you want to play it straight? Anyway I love Jimmy.

329,-Patali-,2019-04-15 10:31:49,0,44,142,"Just trying to think of the most satisfying way to close the series. Long time BB and BCS fan, and I feel this second series has been handled basically as well as it possibly can be.   My hopes/predictions for the last one or two seasons are this:

- Kim possibly has her career ruined by Jimmy, trying to help him with whatever trouble he ends up in this season. This would obviously lead to her leaving him, and him totally losing any remnants of a moral compass, which is almost gone anyway.

- Nacho has suffered enough I believe he will be the first person the vacuum repairman gets out of town, hopefully along with his dad. 

- Small thing, I hope we get some more details on Gus. We know he must have been high level military/intelligence in Chile, but I really want to know why Don Eladio said ""I know who you are."" That always left an extra air of mystery that was never resolved.

- Both series season intros have done his jobs of addressing the final plots of the previous seasons. Hoping 5's intro episodes show us the details of Werner's fallout. 

- Season 5 should be entirely before BB. If we get a Season 6, it should be about Gene. 

And now speaking of the end game:

- Ever since I heard news of a Jesse story post-breaking bad, I've wanted it to feature Saul/Gene as the  main side character. Like, perhaps Jesse is trying to clear his name and seeks out and finds Saul for help. Jesse and James on the run to clear their names. Tell me that doesn't sound like a great movie. I hope this is what the flash forwards are building to. 

- I have never liked the idea of a Walt cameo, cause I could never imagine it being done tastefully. However, some have suggested the idea that the Gene flash forwards could be before Walt went back to ABQ and died. 

Imagine the ghostly and grizzled finale Walt rolling up in Omaha in his Cadillac DeVille. Gene/Jimmy being intimidated as hell. It could be a tense series of episodes featuring both our mains in their post fallout forms. 

This would need to basically be between events of the finale. After Walt gets the car, he'd take a detour to Omaha before heading down to New Mexico. The writers would have to come up with a reason he needs Saul for something. But there's precedent for this as well as had the flash forwards of Walt in the Cadillac that were separate from the finale.

These are problems, but I think the potentially amazing and intense screen material would be worth a few minor inconsistencies. Not expecting this, but it could be be amazing.

- Finally, take note that Kim once mentioned her hometown is Omaha. Wouldn't it be an amazing ending it after having not seen each other for so long, they catch a glimpse of one another

341,OShaunesssy,2019-04-14 02:21:29,0,12,25,"- Kim Wexler is probably the best written character on Tv. She is smart and driven but too trusting and genuinely has fun when she ""slips"" along side Slippin Jimmy. Some of the best scenes of the whole show involve her, most notably her freakout on Howard after Chucks funeral.

- as someone who grew up as the younger brother to my cool older bro I sympathized a ton with the Jimmy/ Chuck storyline throughout the first 3 seasons. I felt both guys were partially justified in their feelings. In fact for most of the show I found myself siding with Chuck as he was the older and more put together and clearly had to put a ton of work prior to HHM. Chuck was the good (righteous) son but his parents always held Jimmy up higher.

- That scene where you see their mom die is unreal, poor Chuck refuses to leave her side and makes sure he is there for her final moments, only for her to call only for Jimmy before dying. And then poor Jimmy never gets to know his mom called out for him and thinks he just fucked up by not being there when she passed.

- Jimmy worked hard early on in life at being selfish and drawing a wedge between himself and Chuck, and you can almost see why Chuck never thought Jimmy's redemption and quest to be a lawyer was genuine. Jimmy was a scummy con man most of his life who Chuck even attributes to the downfall of their fathers store. 

- Side note, their karaoke scene broke me to tears, knowing where their relationship ends up. Chucks demise will go down as one of the darkest moments in Tv history in my opinion. The *thud thud thud* before the lantern topples over gives me chills.

- Howard is my low-key favorite character. He is initially presented as the big antagonist of the show before they reveal Chuck to be behind all of Howard's shitty moments, and for the most part of season 2 and 3 you can see a weird respect Howard has for Jimmy. Their bathroom scene when Jimmy calls him a shitty lawyer is brilliant piece of writing between two guys with so much history. Side note: Howard only seemed to be in a handful of scenes in season 4 and that made me sad.

- What shocks me most about this show is that it's practically 2 shows. One shows the transformation of Jimmy to Saul and the other shows Mike's first footsteps into the criminal underworld. I can count on one hand how many scenes Mike and Jimmy have truly shared together and their storylines often feel miles apart. The benefit of knowing all this intersects in Breaking Bad makes this an easy watch even if it can be sometimes jarring. (Mike dissapearing for the last 2 episodes of season 3 was weird)

- speaking of which, Mike is essentially God right? He is never wrong and always has a plan, even when it seems like he doesnt. Welcome mat is used as surveillance, art project with the garden hose and Kaylee is actually road spikes, chewing gum wrapper is used to jam up parking meter. Mike is unreal, and if the actor wasnt so damn likable this role may not be as sincere. Luckily the actor nails it and you keep rooting for this modern day terminator character. 

- The difference between Mike in Better Call Saul and Mike in Breaking Bad is pretty apparent though. Consider how quick Mike is to kill in BB, like that scene where he kills those 4 or 5 hitmen in that warehouse. He puts them all down without a second thought. But if you look at the first 3 or 4 season of BCS and you see a guy who uses killing only as a last resort. The lengths he went to, in order to not kill Tuco are unreal. Its fascinating to watch this get stripped away from Mike throughout the show. Eventually he knows what he must do and kills that German guy. He wouldnt kill Tuco, a degenerate drug addict low life, but puts down this sweet old man who never really hurt anyone. Mike may be right all the time, but watching his fall from corrupt ex-cop to full blown career criminal hitman is insane and a little heartbreaking.

- also anyone else suspect that all the germans were killed and not just the boss. There is no benefit to shipping them all home sans their role model and boss. That ends with questions, and then I start wondering if the plan was always to kill every construction guy, reguardless of their success. 

- The Gus reveal was good, as was showing us the origins of the meth lab. Seeing all his henchmen and even Gale is crazy considering how fucked up of an ending that everyone meets. Gus killing Nacho's buddy with the plastic bag was fucking gross and uncomfortable.

- I kept having a thought throughout the series, and it always blew my mind. There are scenes where we see Mike and Hector talk to each other, or Gus and Mike, or Gus and Gale and I cant help but think how all these characters and scenes are gonna be undone by some shitty insecure high school chemistry teacher. Mike and Hector sit down for coffee and I immediately think how crazy it is that after all the shit these 2 badass have been through, they will both meet their end due to the involvement of one guy. One guy that no one knows or can plan for, one guy who is probably eating some shitty bacon and eggs at that exact moment. It's crazy to think of the effect Walt will have on everything going on in this show.

- Nacho (or Ignacio) is fast becoming my favorite character. He had such a small and minor role early on that I was wondering why he is main cast, but by season 3 you see how important he is to Hector's story. Knowing that we never see Nacho in BB, I'm legitimately terrified for what ever this guys fate is.

- Chicanary is a masterpiece of television. Everyone should watch it as I think it rivals even the best that Breaking Bad has to offer. That slow zoom in on Chuck as he breaks down is unreal, and perfect. It's not as satisfying as you expect cause there is a real sadness to Chucks menral illness.

- Lalo is clearly being set up as the final big bad of the show I'm thinking. Saul's apparent fear of him in BB is reason enough to know that although the Mike and Saul storylines feel disconnected, they will merge sooner rather than later.

- I'm scared for Kim, I dont imagine she does because I feel like Saul would be even more changed from what we see in BB. By the end of Season 4 Saul is using his fake name as a lawyer and accepted who he is. His monologue to Mike at the end of season 1 about never making that mistake again combined with his speach to that student at the end of Season 4 about how ""they"" will never forget what mistakes she made confirm who Saul is as a lawyer. I can already see the character from BB in the screen, I'd imagine Kim dying would fuck him up really badly. This leads me to assume Kim will walk away from Jimmy, she has to. She is smarter than Jimmy and she will see the path he is heading down and she will leave his ass. At least this is my hope cause I love her, and will be heartbroken if she is killed.

- I have a ton more thoughts but this is getting too long as it is and I gotta get back to work. This show is amazing though and I am in awe of its quality","(Spoilers) just binged the show so far, here are some random thoughts",25

343,MrFranklin49,2019-04-13 22:43:33,0,18,7,"Personally, I have my fingers crossed that Michael McKean will still reappear in Better Call Saul. Yes, he’s been dead for a whole season now and appeared in two flashbacks since Chuck’s death, but he’s such a phenomenal actor and even in the flashbacks he was in during Season 4, he just steals every damn scene he’s in. So it begs to question, will we still see Chuck, whether it’s flashbacks or hallucinations? 

I would personally love to see a Chuck hallucination scene at some point in Season 5. Like when Jimmy changes his name to Saul, I’d love to see a ghost of Chuck saying things like “I told you. I was right all along, Jimmy. I knew you’d end up this way.”  But Saul tells him off and says things back like “You made me this way, Chuck. Had you have just had my back and been a brother like you were supposed to, I wouldn’t be like this.” 

Any excuse Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould can find to keep McKean around, I’ll take it. Chuck may be dead, but he’s certainly not gone from the story. What do you guys think? Anyone agree with me?",Will We See Anymore From Michael McKean as Chuck in Better Call Saul Going Forward?,7

352,hedzinbed,2019-04-11 23:38:17,0,1,12,"Through out the series, we can see the advisary relationship between the two brothers. I don't know if it has been mentioned yet, but it seems like a perfect metaphor for The Law system and The People.

Chuck was highly regarded and respected because he did everything right in life, he played by the rules, won by the books, the definition of lawful, he was firm and fair and thats how the law would be decribed, firm and fair. Often than not, in life things are never black and white, and to be FAIR, sometimes means to be the opposite, to be LAWFUL means hurting people just because the lines in the books of law that you studied say so.

Jimmy, on the other hand, is a good guy at heart, but became crooked, not because he wants to, but because he has to. He made mistakes earlier in life and now he can never get out of it, even if he wanted to, which he did, the world always reminded him that. The reason Jimmy is so likeable is not just because he's relatable, it's also because he is someone we always wanted to be when things were unfair and unjust, someone who did something about it and win.

To sum up, the show up until the end of season 3, its about the creation of Saul, not season 4, ss4 is alllll Saul in action. Because the only thing that mattered was the battle between him and his brother. Saul Goodman is the product of the unjustice in the justice system.",Jimmy v. Chuck metaphor,12

375,samueldavid33,2019-04-10 06:06:51,0,5,3,"I've been really wondering how Walter White would make an appearance in Better Call Saul. It's one of my most hyped moments to witness in a form of fiction ever. Most people suggest it would be the cross over scene in Breaking Bad where Walter meets Saul Goodman as Mr. Mayhew. It sounds interesting but I want something more. The bad ass ending scene from Season 5 Episode 15 of Breaking Bad where the main theme builds up the tension and excitement. and the payoff is so satisfying and addicting even. I want there to be such a buildup, and just at the drop point of the theme, Walter himself or something that strongly refers to Walter would shown, but i prefer the former. Maybe it would be interesting to see the new characters in Better Call Saul interact with Walter in some way. It may seem very random and works on chance in the world of the show but if Jimmy met Ken, the guy with the red car and gets destroyed by Walter in breaking bad, then such an interaction is not out of the realm of possibility. I'm thinking maybe Kim would run into Walter or Hamlin but Hamlin wouldn't make much sense. Walter Jr. could appear in the show as well, indicating the presence of Walter is close. They could like show a scenario where Walter's school, the place he works at, is under some fire or lawsuit, Kim is probably involved in the case and would inquire the students there. One of them could be Walter Jr. I guess they could use this situation to even cameo the Vice principal lady, better yet show Jesse himself. Jesse could still be in high school in the timeline of Better Call Saul and show a side arc of Jesse too. Lots of interesting possibilities and I hope the Better Call Saul team would deliver to our expectations. I cannot wait for season 5!",Walter White's cameo appearance,3

Then in 2.10, at his (their) grandmas hospital bed, we see her saying jimmy, before dying. She wanted to see him. Shortly after she dies. It's commonly said that before you die you see your children. However, she did not say Chuck, which was her sun as well. So somehow Jimmy was special to her, and the very last person Chuck's Mother wanted to see before she died. 

&amp;#x200B;

From an earlier episode, we see Jimmy sensing a 'wolf' in his fathers gas station (or night store, not sure), when this said wolf tries to get Jimmy's father give him money for nothing. Slippin' Jimmy was born, so it seems, after the words of the man who tried to lure his father to give him money: 'There are types of people in the world. Wolves and Sheep. Decide what you're gonna be.' After that Jimmy, sneaks (yes, he steals, but he is cool little Saul, who I, admittely like, so he just sneaks \*whink\*) some money out of the cashier, money his father would not know about. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, we sort of know where the impulse for Jimmy came from to become a slippin' one, but we never heard of Chuck's reason to hate im. Chuck said, he worked his ass off for his position at HMM, and would not want Jimmy to slip in there with his tactics to be an equal to him. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here is my thesis: Chuck is kind of envying Jimmy for his sneakiness, because he gets what he wants, has loving people around him, seems to be healthy (at least now, that he is no longer an employed lawyer, but a self-employed one). In other words, maybe he is Chuck's shadow, sort of successful (could be, he quit the lawyer job, by being annoying and getting fired), has a girlfriend (don't spoil me in case it goes down the drain) and is healthy, unlike Chuck. Sure he might be slippin' to where he is, but he is there nonetheless. ",Wild Guess on Chuck and Jimmy's Relationship (Spoiler till Episode 2.10),2

(BB spoiler)

Mike was my FAVORITE character in Breaking Bad, and seeing his back story I love him even more. Also that speech he has about ""Didn't say you were a bad guy, said you were a criminal."" is very fitting for both series, especially for his own character. 
I thought the symbolism of Mike being the parking guard was very interesting. It seemed like letting people in/out of a frickin court building while he sits there made his neutrality almost tangible. Mike has always been ""get the job done no matter what the job is."" This kinda poked at that a little more. Does that make sense? I dont know if I'm wording that right hahaha.


Did anyone else think Jimmy's switch at the VERY end of the season seemed a little forced? He was all ready to join the case he built, but then there was the shot of his pinky ring and BOOM. He 180ed. I may have to rewatch the last episode again to see if it wasnt too heavy handed, but it seemed very sudden to me. Kinda ended the season on a sour note for me. But maybe I just have to watch it again!


Also, I'm very impressed, and almost  proud, of how far Bob Odenkirk's acting chops have come! Even though he was primarily used as the comic relief guy in BB, I always thought a lot of his material could have been delivered a lot better. However, he's grown a lot and all of his intentions/actions/objectives are crystal clear in this series. He still uses his hands quite a lot, and of course it's hard to top Bryan Cranston as a main character, but there's such significant improvement! In the scene when he confronts Chuck about the deleted call on his cell phone, and his bingo monologue in the last episode of season one really stood out to me.

• Uproxx‘s ranking of the best shows available on Netflix lauds Better Call Saul as “the most detail oriented and perhaps the smartest show on television, and one hell of an intense, suspenseful drama, which is all the more impressive because we know roughly where it will end up.”

• Michael Mando speaks with Filmmaker Magazine about researching roles: “For Better Call Saul, I was fascinated with the Aztec cultures and the Mayans and human sacrifice and all that stuff, which fed me and took me into very strange directions because I wanted to understand the historical culture of the character that I was playing.”

• According to Deadline, Bob Odenkirk will participate in the publication’s fourth annual The Contenders Emmys event on Apr. 7.

I was rewatching BrBa, the episode *Dead Freight* (S5E5). Lydia tells Walt, Jesse and Mike about the train full of methylamine and proposes to rob it. Mike initially objects because he says it would mean having to either kill the crew on the train or leave behind witnesses. 


**Mike:** “You know what this means, don’t you? We gotta off the crew?”

...

**Walter:** “How many guys are in the crew?”

**Lydia:** “Just two. An engineer and a conductor”

...

**Jesse:** “Two guys. Can’t we just tie them up or something?”

**Mike:** “And then what? Even if we wear a mask, we’re leaving two witnesses behind. Bottom line, I have done this long enough to know that there are two kinds of heists: Those where the guys get away with it and those that leave witnesses”



This dialogue directly reflects the time he robbed Hector’s truck in season 2 of BCS. He wore a mask and left the driver as a witness. He didn’t get caught but it ultimately lead to an innocent good samaritan being killed. 

Later in that episode *Dead Freight*, Mike and Walter are having an argument about the heist and Mike says he doesn’t want any innocent people to die. Of course as we all know the train heist also ends with a civilian casualty in the little boy, Drew Sharp.

I would say for me personally I loved the season. I did think it was slower than usual but I think this was on purpose. This season didn't feel like season 3 at all. Season 3 felt like a closer to the old story line. Much like the 4th season of breaking bad. To me this season felt more like season 1. It feels a slow burn that eventually builds up to something fantastic.

484,Boba3964,2019-03-21 00:39:42,0,34,253,"I’m referring to a specific type of dialogue you see often on both shows on occasion. It refers to a monologue or dialogue that you would think would come across as mundane and boring but is somehow very entertaining.

Here are some examples of what I mean:

1) Walt and Domingo talking about his former job at a furniture store before Walt kills him.

2) Mike and the gun peddler discussing the nuances about how the technology of guns has evolved over the years 

3) Walt schooling Victor about the expertise of chemistry with technical terms most fans including myself have never heard before. We still don’t really know what the hell he was talking about specifically. It just didn’t matter that we understood it. It was still entertaining.

4) The vet guy explaining, in detail, to Nacho his recovery advice from the bullet wound he had just sewn up. This one is interesting to me because it shows this guy was probably once a doctor who just lost his license somehow and became a vet as a rebound job.

5) Walt discussing the potential of finding water on Mars.

6) Gus discussing with the Don about the business benefits of selling meth instead of cocaine.

7) The German engineer explaining in great detail to Mike what it would take to actually build a lab underground.

All of these examples give the scenes such a sense of realism and are interesting to listen to, but it’s also odd how they are also such entertaining scenes to re-watch. Somehow explaining mundane details of some topic of expertise is entertaining. I find that brilliant.",One really has to appreciate the subtle brilliance of a specific type of dialogue in both BCS and BB,253

But one thing that got me was there was a ton of it in the last episode, probably more than usual.

You got the slushie guy who got dragged into Lalo's chase for Mike, who just wanted to get out of the parking lot, and got rammed into the street. Then there's Fred, the TravelWire agent who blindly gets manipulated by Mike, then killed once he tries to show authority with Lalo. They're completely devoid of the world of BCS, in their own mundane world going about their lives. They're suckers.

That's the term Jimmy used to Kim once he finished his speech to the bar. They were obviously moved by his speech, even though he didn't mean a single word of it. Obviously Jimmy didn't see Kim being moved by his speech too, but to him, there's winners and losers. The winner takes it all.

Even Werner proves himself a sucker to Mike, constantly messing up, and not being aware what he's gotten himself into, or that leaving the site would get him killed. You can see the hurt in Mike's voice when he tells him, nothing he can do or say will save him, that it doesn't work that way. But Werner was oblivious to that, since he's not a winner.

Jimmy McGill was the loser, the sucker. He got looked over for his bad grades, had his criminal activities always stuck to him, and never got respect from most of the people he worked with. He tried to do good, but it got him nowhere. In Slippin' Jimmy and Saul Goodman, he's the winner. ",An analysis of S4E10 (spoilers),114

However I thinking about the parallel between Werner begging for his life to be spared in the finale and Walt begging for his life to be spared in the season 3 finale of Breaking Bad and how they started off so similar yet ended up drastically different (Werner gets shot vs Walt turning the tables on Mike). With that in mind I interpret Gale talking with Gus as a further illustration of the stark contrasts in outcomes. The scene after Walt's phone call to Jesse, Walt revealing his true intentions, and Mike's attempt to call Gale in his home to warn him, Gale is killed by Jesse which contrasts to the scene after Mike shoots Werner, Gale is able to talk with Gus in what would eventually be the lab and runs into Mike on his way out.

I've seen people saying they believe Kim will die because it's the thing that makes Jimmy ""become Saul"", but considering that Jimmy is pretty neck-deep in the Saul mentality at this point, there is just no need for such a drastic change. I don't see it. This show is pretty watertight with it's writing and a cheap death of such a complex character clashes heavily with the subtlety shown in the rest of the show. And it *would* be cheap. It definitley wouldn't result in Saul Goodman. Even in Breaking Bad, his soul is not completely broken; he has strong reservations about Brock's poisoning, for instance. The only outcome of Kim's death would be a man totally broken with guilt - not a snappy, snarky and sneering huckster like Saul, but a Mike.

It showed that Jimmy really cared about Chuck - bringing him his supplies and all the requisite newspapers and doing it ""just so"" to Chuck's picky likings. I mean, maybe Jimmy's enabling his brother's illness and helping him avoid real help/treatment, but he's just trying his best to get by and help Chuck get by.

Then they find the Sandpiper case, they're working together. Jimmy's work ethic pulls Chuck out of, what, 24 months of recluse and inactivity and gives him purpose and distracts him from his own illness long enough that he goes outside without realizing it.

The brothers are on the right path, they're working a great case with merit - and doing it the proper way. And then....

Chuck (rightly) knows this is too big for them, refers it to HHM, only to block Jimmy from getting picked up by HHM or being able to work it further.

Chuck has to have seen that by putting his focus and all his intensity into this case, it made Jimmy ""go straight"". He was working it the right way. It's an honorable case. But he just can't let his brother get any credit or success. He has to sabotage him, and deceive him by letting Howard look like the bad guy, when really it's Chuck for no reason besides his own.

Jimmy has been nothing but a totally stand-up guy for Chuck. His lifeline to the world. The only person that cares enough to check in on him.

Would Jimmy still have morphed to Saul if Chuck wasn't like this? Would he have taken a path of more or less a credible lawyer able to practice successfully?

Or do we think Chuck was right, he's a ""chimp with a machine gun"" and only would have been bound by his nature to spiral out of control and contribute in so much destruction?

Obviously it had to happen that Chuck would be an antagonist to Jimmy, but really I guess I wrote this thought out since I really liked the Jimmy+Chuck team when they were on the same page. It's a shame Chuck burned it. Without his influence, I don't think Jimmy ""breaks bad"" into Saul, even if he was Slippin Jimmy. It was just kind of sad to me that they didn't have Jimmy do something dumb and really give Chuck a good reason to screw him over in the first season for more evident reasons.","Chuck and Jimmy Season 1 relationship was great, until...",25

According to the unofficial [Breaking Bad timeline](https://breakingbad.fandom.com/wiki/Breaking_Bad_Timeline) and accompanying plot synopsis, Walt and Todd cook in Vamonos Pest houses for roughly three months, working with Declan and Lydia. There are a few items of note here:

* During the first house-cook, Walt &amp; Jesse's ~50 pounds bring $1.379 million after the dealers got their cut. If that cut is 30%, that means the gross take of the cook is that same $40,000 per pound price-point for Walt's product, and they grossed $2 million for that first batch
* If Walt is getting exactly that same amount when cooking with Todd -- it is later revealed to be about $80 million -- and without any extra costs for Todd, the Vamonos Pest guys, Lydia's cut to handle logistics with the Czech Republic (she negotiated 30%), and still producing a 50-pound batch per cook, it would take at least 40 cooks in the 3 months to get to that level
* Since that number (40) is unrealistic to cover all of the additional fees, let's call it 65 -- that's enough to handle Lydia's 30% deal and also pay Todd &amp; the Vamonos guys
* This isn't the point of this post, but let's see what those numbers look like. 65 cooks @ 50 pounds per cook @ $40K/pound gross = $130,000,000. Lydia clears $39 million, and while I'm sure a good chunk of that goes to the various players in her line of work (freight forwarders, Czech dealers, etc.), I'm sure she kept at least $10 million for herself. Todd &amp; the bug guys also keep about $10 million for their own efforts, which is kinda ridiculous for three months worth of work
* Regarding that timeline, if they're going to cook 65 batches in 3 months (13 weeks), that's 5 batches per week, which means the Vamonos guys must have really started ramping up their own bug extermination business simply to provide enough locations for Walt &amp; Todd to do their business. Walt probably had multiple sets of equipment so he could have two or three houses with in-progress batches at once, bouncing around from house to house until they're all finished. Insert whatever other assumptions you'd like here.

Now that all of that is established, which may be worth discussing in more detail by itself, I wanted to bring up Jesse's slave duties with the Nazis, and how much money they were sitting on by the time Walt reappears in Albuquerque.

First, they took most of Walt's money. Seven barrels with $80 million total = about $11-12 million per. They left one Barrel for Walt, meaning they likely collected about $68 million in the desert.

On top of that, they had Jesse cooking for them, and while he only had one cook site, I'm willing to bet they weren't very kind to him, keeping him cooking basically 24/7, largely so Todd could satisfy his crush on ol' Lydia, but I'm sure the money was a nice bonus, too.

According to that same timeline, Jesse was enslaved by Uncle Jack &amp; Co. for about one week shy of six months, so about 25 weeks. Even if Jesse was ""only"" producing two 50-pound batches per week (a conservative estimate), that's still 2,500 pounds, with the Nazis keeping every penny after Lydia's 30% cut. That comes out to an additional $70 million. It's entirely possible that this number could be doubled if they kept Jesse working around the clock, making that closer to $140 million, on top of the ~$68 they already collected in Ozymandias. Those guys don't exactly seem like the kind who are overly concerned with laundering it or investing in T-bills, so that's over $200 million total that Jack &amp; his guys are sitting on -- in cash -- somewhere in the outskirts of Albuquerque NM.

Sure, they spent a few bucks on additional compound security, and that crazy recliner one of the guys dies on, but it's all a relative drop in the bucket to the amount of cash on hand. Meanwhile, Lydia would have grossed another $30-60 million for herself, so after her costs, she's likely worth $20-30 million because of this venture before she enjoys her final packet of Stevia.

My question/reason for bringing this up: holy shit, is this accurate?! Do these numbers add up? Plenty of assumptions were taken, but after watching this show a half-dozen times, I'd like to think those assumptions are pretty reliable, based on how everything plays out and ties together. The total numbers are never brought up, and besides Jack's ""You want your money, right? Huh? You wanna know where it is? You pull that trigger, you'll never -- "", there isn't really any mention of the gigantic amount of exactly how much money has been collected and is sitting somewhere at Jack's compound.

Also, potentially very related: it could possibly be one angle that the upcoming BB movie addresses. I'm still convinced that Jesse is broken -- mentally, emotionally, physically, etc. -- and doesn't have much time left after his escape before he does something rash, but maybe returning to the Nazi compound and collecting 9-figures to give to Kaylee Ehrmantraut, the family of Drew Sharp, some college scholarship fund named after Gale (the Rocket Man Endowment Fund?), his narcotics anonymous group, or whatever else he pleases. If it was out in the open, surely the cops would seize it when they appeared at the end of the series, but if they made Jesse bury it nearby, Walt-style, there's a chance it's still sitting out there by the time the movie rolls around.

I've recently rewatched all of BB and BCS and while everyone's got theories on Kim's departure from Jimmy, I've been wondering moreso the most plausible exit for Howard.

A lot of speculation around Howard as Season 3 was airing revolved around the idea of him driving drunk home from Chuck's the night be brought over the 35 year old Macallan. (Remember the screenshot of him sitting outside Chuck's house at night, the shadows of the tree branch looking like a scar across this face?) Considering his depressed state in Season 4 and very occasional appearances, despite his seeing an emotional upswing at the finale of Season 4, I would doubt very much Howard's demons regarding Chuck's death and his self imposed guilt about it has been fully kept at bay. 

It would make sense that Howard is overwhelmed by the full responsibility of the firm falling squarely on him, and coupled with the guilt of Chuck's suicide, would be entirely plausible that Howard starts drinking more heavily. We've seen how he keeps cabinets of fine scotches and whiskeys around the office, and enjoys a drink to celebrate, but maybe it starts with helping him sleep (per the mentioned insomnia). Maybe he has a win at the office in which he, on the one hand, feels like the firm is finally getting its old reputation back, on the other hand, the victory feels hollow, as he can't escape the guilt of Chuck's death. So he drinks, and drinks more than usual. Drives home. Pulled over. Maybe, to make matters even worse, attempts to bribe the cop into letting this slide. He's arrested.

Now, facing jail time, and his own disbarment, HHM has completely fallen down the tubes. No lawyer will come to Howard's aid. Kim would, but her bosses at S&amp;C won't have it. Not good for the image. So she talks Jimmy into taking it. He could make a positive name for himself. Jimmy doesn't want to, but takes Howard's case at Kim's urging. Howard is grateful, but still can't let get his head out of his own ass. Maybe he makes a crack about Saul Goodman sounding like an ambulance chaser. Maybe he says something else. And Jimmy remembers everything he hates about Howard. His bootlicking of Chuck. The Gollum comment. Comes to decide that if HHM desolves he can get his settlement money sooner, or even a bigger slice of the pie. Throws Howard's case in court, in spectacular non-Saul or Jimmy savvy fashion. Uncharacteristically unprepared or perhaps just doesn't defend, even acts like a secondary prosecutor. I'm not a lawyer so I'm fuzzy on details on how it would play out. Regardless, Howard faces charges. Is disbarred. HHM is done for. Maybe this is what drives Kim to be so disgusted by Jimmy she is completely done with him. She sees him as being completely driven by the wrong reasons, and everything she found admirable in him is gone.

Howard never works in law again. HHM is gone. Jimmy gets a large cut of the settlement to bankroll the Saul office.

If you want a ""Heisenberg moment"", maybe the last thing Jimmy says to Howard is revealing he ruined his own career over misplaced guilt, because it was he who blew the whistle on Chuck's mental illness to the insurance providers in the first place.

In Season 2, black and white begun cutting into these shots, which is only seen in the scenes following Gene in Omaha. In Season 4, the shots begin to cut to black and white more frequently and their colors separate on occasion, along with general ‘glitch’ effects.

My personal theory is that the shots will have some meaning to the final ten episodes of the series, and the black and white symbolizes the crawl closer and closer to Gene. Maybe the final season’s openings will be entirely black and white, and it will follow Gene.

Of course Jimmy was really directing that speech toward himself and uses it as motivation to become Saul Goodman but in reality it doesn't apply to him at all.

Did Jimmy have people like Chuck who tried to keep him down due to his past reputation? Sure. But despite his past he was given a great job at Davis &amp; Main. He's a high level attorney at the firm, still has Sandpiper case, and is afforded a huge office and lots of respect. THIS IS THE CLUB THAT ""THEY"" WERE SUPPOSEDLY NOT LETTING JIMMY IN. And he threw it all away, not because somebody was scheming to sabotage him, but because he was bored with it. 

People don't see Jimmy as his one mistake because he continues to make mistakes and abusing the trust of people who do give him chances. This is what Kim was talking about when she said that Jimmy is ""always down"". This is what Chuck was talking about when he said that Jimmy will always be Slippin Jimmy.

I'm sure Jimmy will eventually have his ""I did it because I liked it and because I was good at it"" moment but right now his heel turn is extra despicable because he's still trying to justify his actions by painting himself as the victim.

The shot of their silhouettes in the darkness is such an amazing shot. And the ending. This is just like Walter White, you start out rooting for him and then you slowly see him become the bad guy.

Obviously, there are big differences between Saul and Walter's criminal status. Walter was one of the most wanted men in the country, and we really haven't heard much about Saul. At this point, we still speculate if he's still wanted or if its just his paranoia that keeps him in NE. If the repair man can drive clear across the country for Walter visits and supplies, it's possible he drops by NE or at least phones to give updates.

679,botheredbysmallstuff,2019-02-08 01:30:22,0,13,11,"Although, like many, I started BCS because of BB, I've grown to love the spinoff even more than the original series. I think it has a narrative maturity (forget about that on the nose Tuco close-up in the first episode) that BB presented only a few times.

That said, at this point, I just don't want a Walt or Jesse cameo, given it probably would make the show a lot more ""dependent"" of BB (which I don't think it is at all at the moment). Let's face it, though, it's very likely that it will happen and, with that in mind, I thought about the only way I see it happening and not sucking. First, I think it needs to be Walt (leave Jesse the movie).

Season 5 brings all the characters together and sets up this big final act with everyone involved. 

Season 6, the last, starts with a Gene scene where we gather trough the news or something like that the Heisenberg scheme, including the deaths of Mike and Gus (this could be present in Season 5 Gene scene too). 

Episodes 1-8 of the season solves the big final act, pushes Kim away from the picture and ends with Saul's criminal career well established. At the end of Episode 8, we go back to Gene watching the news. Someone knocks the door (pun not intended): it's Walt, right before his death.

Episode 9 is 50 minutes of Walt and Gene talking about their failures and their flaws, reflecting on their choices and the lives they destroyed (Mike can come up). If you watched BB, you're gonna understand all the layers, sure, but if you didn't, you can enjoy it as a recap of the themes of the series: the main character, face to face with an ex client (whom they can set up the existence since Season 5 Gene scene, as I said), thinking back on his moral decisions. Walt goes away and we fast forward a few months/days to Gene finding out about his death in the news. End of Episode 9. The last episode is all about Gene (and Kim, mayhaps).

I think this way, Walt can appear more as this embodiment of all of Jimmy's bad choices (his mirror, almost) and thus not making the show ""dependent"" of another. Jesse could work as this character too, but I think his arc is too open for an episode featuring him not being completely about him.

Considering that “A lot of us in the writers’ room are big ***Big Lebowski*** fans” as BCS writer/producer/director Tom Schnauz said in this [interview](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/better-call-saul-pimento-postmortem-115128743980.html), the writers’ decision to use Kahlua is now more apparent.

Following is my compilation of references, nods, and homages to [***The*** ***Big*** ***Lebowski***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Lebowski) (“TBL”) scattered throughout BCS. Tom Schnauz has mentioned a few of these in interviews, a few others appear to be pretty intentional or at least inspirational given the ~~context~~ frame of reference of the scene in which they appear, and a few seem to be interesting coincidences where I am hopefully not out of my element...

&amp;#x200B;

***That’s Marvelous*** ***~~Seymour~~*** ***Henry***

In BREATH, Henry at Neff Copiers takes great pride in showing off Mr. Neff’s various awards, ceremonial key to the city, and other philanthropic activities to Jimmy in a scene that was inspired by Brandt and The Dude at Mr. Lebowski’s house [(comparison here)](https://imgur.com/a/IRHdhdj) in TBL.  Henry’s character was originally named “Seymour” in honor of Phillip Seymour Hoffman who played Brandt, but due to legal/clearance issues, the character was renamed “Henry”

EDIT: Per Tom’s twitter: “There was a clearance issue, we couldn't use Philip Seymour, or Seymour Hoff or Hoffman, so we went with Henry Seymour. But he's SEYMOUR in my script.”

&amp;#x200B;

***Those Difficult Pomeranians That Eat Furniture***

In SABROSITO Francesca mentions difficult Pomeranians in a phone conversation with a client. It’s interesting that of the hundreds of possible dog breeds that could have been selected for this dialogue, the writers specifically chose to use the same breed as the furniture-eating show dog (with papers) that Walt baby sits for his former wife in TBL [(comparisons here)](https://imgur.com/a/7imqRbN).  \[Side Note: In that phone chat, Francesca mentions a “Ms. Valance” which is a nod to the movie ***The*** ***Man*** ***Who*** ***Shot*** ***Liberty*** ***Valance***  which had a scene that was likely the [inspiration for the Season 3 Finale of BCS](https://www.reddit.com/r/betterCallSaul/comments/94tj2p/chucks_last_scene_in_the_season_3_finale_is_a/))

&amp;#x200B;

***Kidnapping Oneself***

The Kettlemans “kidnap” themselves similarly to how and why Bunny Lebowski “kidnapped” herself in TBL. Coincidentally, on his late night walk in OFF BRAND, Chuck passes a theater showing the 1965 movie ***Bunny*** ***Lake*** ***is*** ***Missing*** whereas ""Bunny L(ebowski) is Missing” in TBL.  [(screen caps here)](https://imgur.com/a/sWB5sjx) ​

***Sobchak***

PIMENTO’s [Sobchak](https://breakingbad.fandom.com/wiki/Sobchak) is an homage to Walt Sobchak in TBL who also favors wearing camo fatigues, has issues with pistols and also owns a security company that provides  protection [(comparison here)](https://imgur.com/a/UoC41ou).  Not sure yet how well BCS Sobchak rolls or if he won’t roll on Saturdays...

&amp;#x200B;

***Obviously*** ***You’re*** ***Not*** ***a*** ***Golfer***....

It is kind of interesting that the ONLY **carpet** specifically unrolled/displayed in a warehouse full of **carpets** in OFF BRAND has [bowling balls and pins](https://imgur.com/a/pLJPERN) on it. In SLIP Jimmy also make a reference to “Glow in the Dark” bowling night, when I’m assuming there are no league games.

&amp;#x200B;

***He Looks Like Sam Elliott? That’s Your Look, Sam Elliott!***

At the Five J's Auto Parts junk yard (where Mike dismantles his station wagon in MABEL), the owner looks surprisingly like Sam Elliott who portrayed the Narrator in TBL [(comparison here)](https://imgur.com/a/5aif21U)

&amp;#x200B;

***It’s Exhausting Not Caring  About Anything***

Wondering if those shots of Jimmy floating in the pool in MABEL were inspired in part by Uli the nihilist in TBL. [(comparison here)](https://imgur.com/a/gAkUSVx)

&amp;#x200B;

***Where’s*** ***the*** ***Gipsy*** ***Kings*** ***Song***, ***Golubic***?

Thinking that maybe some fondness for the Gipsy Kings' flamenco rendition of ""Hotel California"" in TBL may have inspired a decision to use the Gipsy Kings version of “A Mi Manera”  (aka “My Way”) during Kim’s post-it note/phone call montage in REBECCA. Also wondering if the close up of Kim’s hand at the start of the scene was inspired by the close up of Jesus Quintana’s bowling glove-covered hand in TBL.

Because it was on Mondays, it got me through the week. Toward the end of season 3 when Chuck seemed to be doing well with his mental health and was actually making plans for the future and working on therapy techniques I loved those moments. Then when he killed himself it was absolutely gutting and it made me feel hopeless about my own recovery. Even though it's such an artistically important moment in this show it almost felt cruel of the showmakers to take it that direction, because so much of their thought process is ""what would this character do next"". Seeing the guy who was struggling with his mental health but starting to break through just end it like that was devastating. I don't think I've told anyone because it seems weird, it's just TV, but immediately after that episode I started having suicidal thoughts again when I hadn't in months. I'm doing awesome overall now and have met people in the real world with anxiety disorders who are doing well and give me more hopeful examples to compare myself to, but at the time the characters felt so real to me and it was one of the only places in the media that I was seeing with a character that was dealing with mental illness.

In Chicanery, Chuck presents a façade in the episode that he loves Jimmy and is not trying to destroy his brother, but when he finds out Jimmy planted a battery on him, his façade crumbles and he has an emotional breakdown. 

Likewise, in Winner, it is Jimmy who puts up a façade that he is mourning his brother and that his brother means a lot to him, he too has an emotional breakdown when his car doesn't start. However, Jimmy's breakdown occurs when no one is looking and when he is in court he pulls off his façade at his reinstatement hearing.

Additionally with those keys pulled together, it is Jimmy who is the winner because he was able to maintain his façade throughout  the hearing and his reward is his law license.

EDIT:

1. I have it ending that way because Saul doesn't know what he's in for with Walter White, and the first time they meet is Walt posing as Mr. Mayhew. How dangerously big it's about to be, and knowing the writers of Breaking Bad love to add comedy -- as does Bob Odenkirk -- it'd be funny if Saul did say something along the lines of him hoping he never has to deal with anything that difficult again.
2. It won't show too much Breaking Bad, but I think we could possibly see some scenes of Saul behind Breaking Bad, say being stressed out and whatever goes on in his personal life, Kim Wexler, etc. Although I believe we do see a whole episode of Saul escaping Albuquerque and turning into Gene.
3. I think somewhere along the line we see Saul turn into a whole new person who gets greedy to the point he barely knows who he is until -- and I do know this isn't Breaking Bad -- he sees what Walt is doing to him mentally.",Better Call Saul scene before transitioning fully into Breaking Bad [Spoilers],84

&amp;#x200B;

1 - Saul Goodman's arc it's finished already, we can see that in the last scene where he decides to change his name. We can see several clues that he actually wanted to be a nice guy but that the long period without doing what he likes broke him. He turns into the Saul from Breaking Bad, and we already know that arc, there's no point in showing to us again.

2 - Saul calls a lawyer to defend Francesca in case she gets caught. IF Season 5 takes place after BB, the possible characters would be Kim, Howard (and if I'm wrong) OR a character that is going to be introduced in season 5. There's no point making it a secret otherwise.

3 - Mike one of the most diplomatic characters in the series kills for money. And we know what happens after that. I just can't see what Mike has to offer between visiting the future lab in the end of S4 and the ""knows a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy"" sentence from Saul in Breaking Bad.

&amp;#x200B;

There are downsides because there are anything about Nacho, so my guess would be Mike and Nacho in a arc together somehow. BCS in this case could be two timelines ocurring in the same season?

The episode begins with Mike going to the church, seeing as the church needs money for activities and other things, but only gives a twenty to get them away from him and make Stacy happy.

As the seasons goes through, Lalo is becoming more aggressive and demanding in the business, trying to take the top spot currently held by Nacho. Lalo ends up manipulating Tio into taking the front end from Nacho, meanwhile as Nacho doesn't care that he has the front end, Lalo keeps a close eye on Nacho and wants him by his side most of the time. This makes fleeing harder for Nacho, but wants to get it done not just quickly but in the best way he possibly can do so.

Nacho goes over to visit Saul as he remembers him as a reasonable man. (In a previous episode Lalo gets involved with Saul as Nacho manages to tag along, telling him all that happened with Tio and his stroke, etc.). Nacho tells him that he rigged Tio's medication and explains how he's in the middle, and the whole reason that happened was because he didn't want his Dad to get involved in the life he's stuck in. Nacho says to Saul, 'If there is any way, you could find an easy way for me to flee the country without being traced, I'll pay extra money, just make it happen. I know what these men are capable of, the moment they find me I'm dead, look I don't care about me, it's my father that matters more here because he didn't sign up for this, but me... whether I like it or not I'm stuck.' As Nacho leaves, Saul thinks about how he should add as much connections as possible, as he knows he has the power to make any problem go away without any problems now.

Mike is called in to talk with Saul about what kind of criminal connections he could possibly have, and Mike gives a huge list of things people would like but are illegal to get a hold of, how he might be able to get some but would be lots of work to do.

Nacho is currently finding a way to get Lalo off his back and at the same time to give Gus less of a worry in order to not have Nacho in his thoughts. 

Saul finally gets a connection from Ed for the clandestine service of taking people, gives him his card and tells him all the details on what to do. Moments after Ed leaves, he writes down all the info to give to Nacho on what to do before giving him a call. Nacho picks up the phone to Saul, telling him that he could help him with all of his problems. As Nacho knows he can't leave the cartel, he tries to think of what he could do so that nobody knows about what happened to him or his Dad -- that is left a mystery for now throughout the series to be found out in the next episode. Nacho intentionally works up Lalo in order to make him seem like the big boy and show Gus who the boss truly was. Lalo calls Nacho to meet with Gus to get what he wants.

They head out to the Factory Farm to meet up with Gus. Lalo steps in the room with confidence thinking he was going to leave the meeting the bigger man, showing the family how valuable he truly believes he is. Lalo breaks a rule everybody in that room witnesses showing Lalo he's the only guy in that very room, and Gus is very angry. He takes a slight look at Nacho showing that he truly is angry; Nacho knows something is about to go down and looks very nervous meanwhile Lalo looks confident that he's still the big boy. Gus walks over to Lalo very politely, basically showing him what true manners look like. He grabs a cup of coffee, later sneaking in poison and hands it right over to Lalo. Lalo enjoys the coffee, but just as Gus stages a discussion, he falls to his death. Gus looks right at Nacho and says, ""He broke the one rule anybody should never break and crossed the one line that should never be crossed."" He looks back at Tyrus and Victor and says, ""Clean up this mess,"" then looks at Nacho and says, ""Get yourself some rest.""

Saul continues on with the day figuring out what kind of connections he'd need in terms of crime. He manages to get many more, some of which with the help of Mike.

The moment Nacho gets home he tells his Dad everything that happened, telling him that they need to leave, no time to ask questions, sell the business, pack up everything and go. Nacho and his father flee away to Winnipeg.

The episode ends with Mike being called into Saul's office, giving Mike a big bonus as he wouldn't have gone this far if it weren't for him. Mike cashes the check not knowing what to do with it, then sees that he could give it to the church.

I find it interesting that Vince would start the production of another project in the BB universe right in the middle of the BCS series. Why would he get all the actors needed to continue BCS, put BCS on the backburner, and start a new project before he finishes the last?

As some have suggested, the movie is probably a front for the new season of BCS. Vince would need to get all of the actors together to film without spoiling to the public exactly who is going to be in the new season. Obviously if someone spots Cranston down in Albuquerque they will know that Walter White is in the new season. Unless he leads everyone to believe that he and others are there to film a separate movie, not the new BCS season.

Now here's the thing about the name Greenbrier. The Greenbrier is a resort built in 1913 in the mountains of West Virginia. The resort has casinos, golf courses, sports centers, everything. People had been visiting this place for decades. Although, it wasn't until 1992 the public discovered it wasn't just a resort.

In the 50s the US government had built a [super secret bunker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Greek_Island) underneath the resort as a hideaway for government officials in the case of a nuclear attack. For decades thousands of people had visited the resort and no one had any idea what was going on underneath it until The Washington Post revealed it's true purpose in '92.

My point being, the Greenbrier was a front by the US Government. On the surface it was a fun place for people to vacation and relax but in reality it had a super important hidden purpose that the government kept on lockdown.

Could Vince's Greenbrier be the same? Could this Greenbrier be a front for something deeper? Something Vince is trying to keep secret?

I guess we'll have to wait.",Theory about the new BB Movie,412
732,umnothing,2019-01-25 22:34:37,0,9,54,"I have been trying to work on some important work for my job, but keep wasting time by writing my assessment of Jimmy McGill's relationship to his brother, and how it ultimately triggered the final steps of his evolution/devolution into full-on, unencumbered Saul Goodman. I've been compiling these thoughts since the end of season four. They are primarily about the brothers' relationship to one another, how it affected Jimmy, and how he dealt with those feelings. I felt the need to write this all down for a few reasons. First of all, I don't know anyone who watches this show and it's a show that I really need to unpack. It's an amazing and complex story that stirs up real emotions inside of me, and I can't talk to anybody about it! Secondly, I thought it could be a useful or at least fun read for people who have similar thoughts but haven't had the chance to sit down and parse them out. Lastly, I'm a writer by nature, and this is how I have to organize the thoughts swirling through my head so I can get back to my ""real"" work!

**A quick note**: I quote some characters in it, but the quotes are from memory so they may be a word or two off. 

DO NOT READ IF YOU AREN'T CAUGHT UP! Here we go:

**The Emotional Life of Jimmy McGill and the Evolution of Saul Goodman**

Many episodes of *Better Call Saul!* are put together in such a way that a viewer can’t quite make a complete assessment of what’s happened without a second viewing. The show’s plotlines hinge entirely on pure character motivation; no exposition, no dialogue to over-explain anything, no ham-fisted, obvious plot devices whatsoever. No character makes any decision that doesn’t make absolute sense, and comes from an emotional place. Jimmy McGill has a rich and fascinating emotional life, one that has been carefully pieced together by the show’s creative team. With a well-earned, long-time-coming, major event happening at the end of season three, the death of Jimmy’s brother Chuck, there was no shortage of emotion for the show’s main character, Jimmy McGill. 

At first glance, it would seem that Jimmy was completely undisturbed by his brother’s death. He is quiet, doesn’t want to talk about it, never cries about it, and is upset that everyone else seems to believe he should be sad about it. But if taken at face value, a viewer would miss out on the rich and believable reaction to a family member’s death that this is. Many people react this way when an important player in their life dies, whether it’s a parent, sibling, or spouse that they had a rough relationship with. The familial attachment is there, regardless of if you want to call it love, or even consider it love. In Jimmy’s case, there was a lot between them that had gone unsaid, and a lot that they wanted from each other but never got. 

The brothers McGill had a strained relationship, however, theirs is a unique and satisfyingly realistic portrayal of sibling rivalry. Jimmy was mom and dad’s precious child, the baby of the family, who in turn stole from his father’s shop and chose a life of slipperiness, crookedness, dishonesty, and crime. Chuck, ever the hard and honest worker, graduated from high school at the age of fourteen and went on to become a successful lawyer and renowned member of the legal community. And yet, Jimmy still managed to outshine Chuck in their parents’ eyes – to the point that their mother’s final word was “Jimmy!” before dying (while Chuck waited by her side and Jimmy was off grabbing a bite to eat, mind you). 

And yet, as Chuck’s resentment of his brother grew and grew, Jimmy still looked up to him. While Jimmy was the favorite in their parents’ eyes, Chuck was the favorite in the eyes of the world. Chuck had the prestige, the success, the wealth, the accolades. Chuck knew that this is what he had on his brother: an illustrious career and a great deal of respect among a respectable community of people. Jimmy is a rat, a no-goodnik, pulling off cheap, cheesy cons, and dancing in and out of jail. This is Chuck’s prize for being the unrecognized good son all those years, and Jimmy’s punishment. 

After the Chicago sunroof incident, Chuck’s dominion over Jimmy is sealed, at least temporarily, as Jimmy now owes Chuck everything for lawyering him out of a lifetime of trouble. While this was presumably more so because of Chuck’s guilt and lingering desire to gain the approval of their parents, it still had the added benefit of giving him some form of power, some sort of something to have over his conniving brother. Chuck agreed to help Jimmy, and Jimmy accepted Chuck’s offer of a job in the mailroom. The two estranged brothers were now tied to one another. This was both brothers’ biggest mistake. 

Jimmy’s announcement to Chuck that he had passed the New Mexico bar and was able to practice law was an issue with Chuck for multiple reasons. Sure, Chuck probably wished his brother would not cause much excitement and continue to work beneath him. But on a deeper level, Chuck has spent a lifetime building a career in the legal field, and takes himself and his profession incredibly seriously. Jimmy gets a degree from a joke of a school, passes the bar on this third try, then has the audacity to suggest he should be made a partner. Not only that, but now Jimmy, with or without HHM, is going to be a practicing lawyer and member of the legal community in the same city as Chuck. Chuck’s reputation is now on the line, potentially vulnerable to ridicule, at the hands of the other McGill. All these feelings that these two brothers have for one another are kept hidden from the other. Both know that any inch, any confession of hurt feelings, resentment, or guilt would only be used as a weapon against them by the other. So they keep it all to themselves. 
As much of a threat to Chuck’s lifestyle Jimmy is, Chuck is also a threat to Jimmy’s lifestyle. His lifestyle of skirting the rules, taking shortcuts, and getting ahead the easy way, that is. Chuck is the only person in Jimmy’s life who truly sees the full scope of who Jimmy is. He’s seen the consistent pattern of Jimmy’s behavior, from childhood to adulthood, how he never really puts in any real amount of effort to become a sincere, trustworthy person, and Jimmy knows this. Chuck sees through to his core, and is so disgusted by it that he will go through any amount of trouble to prove it to those around him, and Jimmy knows this. Jimmy went to the copy store to bribe the clerk, just based on the intuition that Chuck would go there to snoop. Chuck was willing and able to expose any lie Jimmy tried to maintain, and that is a major threat to who Jimmy is. 

So, when Chuck develops his disorder and becomes a recluse, finally Jimmy can breathe a little. In fact, both of them can. It’s probably the most symbiotic the two brothers have ever been. Chuck can wield his disorder over Jimmy to get him to run little errands and be sympathetic, and Jimmy gets to feel like a good little brother for obliging. Jimmy doesn’t have to worry about Chuck meddling in his affairs, and Chuck has an excuse to remain blissfully ignorant of any illicit business Jimmy may be involved in. But of course, this unhealthy codependence couldn’t last long. 

What happens next is a complex series of events, each one feeding naturally into the other, eventually culminating in – major spoiler alert – Chuck’s suicide. The two brothers who shouldn’t have been in each other’s lives at all had thrust themselves headfirst into a closer relationship, and it was a grave mistake. Now, Jimmy is left with some complicated feelings. He had lost his brother in the midst of a nasty spat. Chuck, wanting to seem strong and unaffected by what Jimmy had done, decided to tell Jimmy “To tell you the truth, you never really mattered all that much to me,” And while we can see that Jimmy mattered a lot to Chuck, in a brotherly way maybe but definitely in a negative sense, Jimmy probably took that statement at face value. Another thing for the brothers to swallow, push down, ignore. And then Chuck is gone. To make matters worse, here comes Howard to unload his baggage about the insurance. This statement did two things to Jimmy: for one, it revealed to him that he played a part, a big part, in what triggered Chuck’s relapse and suicide, no doubt sparking a pang of guilt inside Jimmy. However, it also gave Jimmy a sort of scapegoat for this guilt – Howard. So that’s the first thing that stood out to me: I had wondered why Jimmy went from being sullen to being glib and aloof. He had a lot dumped on his lap by Howard, and so he gave a little jab to Howard (“Well Howard, I guess that’s your cross to bear,”) and begins making a pot of coffee. No tears, no anger, nothing. Just put on a phony façade and ignore the issues at hand. It’s been working well for him so far. 

The next strange behavior from Jimmy is when he goes in for his infamous interview at Neff Copiers. He gets the job immediately after putting on a hokey little “song-and-dance” and is amazed that it worked as well as it did. He’s almost blown away. This is the first time he really realizes the power he has over people, like really sees it happen before him. He couldn’t take the job, the first job he’s had working for someone other than a client since he became a lawyer, because he had no respect for the people he would have been working for. Hell, they didn’t even notice that they had little tchotchke worth thousands of dollars just sitting on a shelf! A tchotchke which Jimmy uses as a happy distraction from everything else going one, a small-time, lame stunt for someone like Jimmy to pull. Mike sees this and tells Jimmy as much. “It’s not for me, and I don’t think it should be for you,”

Then we get to Chuck’s letter. Lots of people looked way too deep into this one, but from what I see it’s much simpler. The letter from Chuck is pretty cut and dry. It’s a nice little letter, nothing special, and I think he meant most of what he said to Jimmy. Nothing in the letter is so mushy-gushy that it warranted a big reaction from Jimmy, except for the fact that it was written by his dead brother, so that’s where the emotions hinge. The letter does make mention of the day Jimmy was born, and being so special to Mother – an indication that Chuck still dwells on the favoritism that was given to Jimmy. At any rate, the degree to which Chuck was being genuine in the letter is more or less irrelevant.  Jimmy is far from sentimental either way, and refuses to let anything regarding his brother affect him in any way. This sets the tone for the entirety of Jimmy’s reaction to Chuck’s death. Jimmy’s heart is hardened fully, a process that has been happening over the years and is now complete. Kim sees this, but doesn’t realize the degree to which Jimmy has allowed his heart to harden. She doesn’t yet realize that his emotions have become obstacles to him to be avoided and destroyed, or how this new Jimmy may not be able to tend to their relationship any longer. This is very a very real thing that happens to people, and it’s amazing to watch play out. 

Next, we have Kim deciding to practice alone, and telling Jimmy that she doesn’t want to create Wexler/McGill any longer. This is a really big blow to Jimmy, who had been counting on this to be his future after he gets reinstated. All at once he realizes that she is past that, she’s a genuine lawyer, an upstanding and career-driven person who has no need to partner with him in the same way that he needs to partner with her – to give himself some legitimacy. No more Kim by his side, she’s a big shot now. While this is a huge blow, he can’t let it faze him, not this late in the game. Things get better when she and Jimmy pull a couple more cons together, bringing them closer and reminding them of the excitement they can create for and with one another. But still, Jimmy can’t deny the fact that they are on different playing fields. For Jimmy, pulling cons is a lifestyle and passion. For Kim, it’s a hobby; nothing more than a dirty secret. These realizations leave Kim Wexler hanging by a thread in the life of Jimmy McGill. 

Every emotional development that Jimmy has undergone in season four climaxes in the full realization of the show’s titular character, Saul Goodman. When Jimmy goes in for his reinstatement interview, he puts on a little song-and-dance in the same variety of the one he gave months earlier at Neff Copiers. After seeing the powers he had really play out and work, he assumes it should work the same way again, and so he fills his interview with folksy clichés and cheesy charm. The board, however, sees through it easily and docks him for his lack of “sincerity”, withholding his reinstatement, and if they had done anything else it would have tarnished the show’s integrity. 

This realization that sincerity is his missing ingredient is what sends Jimmy into full throttle sociopathy. His hardened heart, which he no longer allows to feel real emotion, must now learn to manufacture sincerity. This has been something Jimmy has had inklings of in the past, but he only used it to swindle people out of petty cash, or woo clients; small stuff. Now he must fake a moving speech, trot out emotions, act as though he were really experiencing them, and say exactly what he knows they want to hear. He borrows those emotions which have been tamped down, all of his feelings towards Chuck, and uses them to his advantage. Emotions he once viewed as obstacles he has now learned to use as tools to persuade or dupe others – clever but sickening. Once this sociopathy has fully enveloped him, he is no longer the innocent character we’ve been watching all this time. Kim believes he’s back, himself again, as tears well up in her eyes watching him bear what he’s convinced everyone is a soul. But as soon as he’s out of that room, she realizes that what she thought was a breakthrough was actually another swindle. What could have been a breakthrough, was instead just a severe emotional manipulation. We’re left with the face of a devastated and confused Kim Wexler as Jimmy tells her that it’s all good, man. 

Up to this point, we’ve seen Jimmy McGill resemble Saul Goodman in many ways: their flair, their tackiness, their creativity, their knack for exploitation. We’ve seen the ingredients pop up here and there: Jimmy’s colorful suits, characters like Huell and Francesca, Jimmy’s knack for keeping criminals out of jail. But throughout, Jimmy has had heart. He’s been somebody to root for. In the show’s parent series, *Breaking Bad*, the leading man began as a sympathetic character but devolved into pure evil relatively quickly, leaving the viewers to instead root for those around him. Jimmy has been sympathetic enough all the way through. Even now that he’s “become” Saul Goodman, we’re still rooting for him, hoping he comes out okay and doesn’t hurt anyone too badly. He’s a bad guy, but he’s really not a *bad* guy, to borrow a phrase. But he is now the character we knew he would be going in, the character that inspired the series after all, the crappy billboard lawyer who makes you wonder *who goes to that guy?* He’s now officially Saul Goodman, and it’s been a very satisfying journey and wonderful piece of artwork to enjoy.

-Tune Down - Chris Joss (an obvious choice, played when Mike steals the Kettleman money)  
-Weary Mike - Dave Porter (the resting scene that takes place following his Tuco beating)  
-Cold Feet - Fink (played when Nacho is practicing the medicine switch, so it isn't a 'Mike' song but I think it's a great fit)
