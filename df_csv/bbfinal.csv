JotaJade,2019-06-20 12:11:30,0,13,29,First of all I have to say that I really loved this series I had never watched any series and damn was this good  For me Breaking Bad is all about the characters It explores every relationship every feeling every personality You know people are complex and the person we show to others isnt the same person that we are inside Breaking Bad manages to show that person inside of every main character   Walter White is a confusing character and I think I know why The show made me like him from episode 1 it manipulates the viewer into thinking the character is good and loveable Thats why even after he does disgusting things I still kinda feel in his side And its amazing how they do it Even throughout the entire last season I still feel favorable for him Breaking Bad tells its story from Walters point of view and that just makes very onesided   Jesse Pinkman is well hes such an emotional and heartbreaking character Hes the good kid in a wrong world It reminds me of that occasional person you talk to whose first impression might portray a junkie or a person of bad habits but when you talk with them they seem like the nicest person in the world Jesse is a victim of the cruel world it always feels like hes out of place and for the viewer its so sad to see him suffer when he really doesnt deserve   Skyler White is weird for me I really dont like her Maybe its because of what I said before In the end of the day shes kind of a rival to Heisenberg But I think its more complex than that In the White family the victims are actually the children not Skyler and obviously not Walter Shes the mom who always wants to assert her dominance over everyone always wants to be on command and always wants to rule For me its just anoying Dont get me wrong its a great character because it portrays that idea really well   Mike oh Mike Mike is one of my favorite characters Hes the guy I cant even describe him hes just the guy thats above everything the guy whos there and who noone messes with but a guy whos actually reasonable and levelheaded The acting is also on point   Gus Fring is mindblowing It seems that only Walter could really catch up to his level of caution and intelligence He always has the answer always pervented always one step ahead Its really cool to watch him Its also interesting that he never reveals emotion until Walter is an actual threat to him  There are much more that deserve a deep analysis and we could spend years talking about how these characters are and how they interact These were the ones I wanted to comment on I also wanted to say something about Saul but I think its already long enough Im looking foward for his spinoff though I actually love his character  Have a nice day,I just finished Breaking Bad and

firefistzoro,2019-06-19 11:13:48,0,16,4,TLDR Walt handed Jesse to the Nazis to be killed Once Walt finds out blue meth is still around a smart man like Walter will surely deduce that Jesse is being forced to cook against his will especially since he knows how badly Jesse wants to get out of that life The theme of the finale was Walt being a ghostshadowChrist like figure planning everything to perfection and tying up lose ends It doesnt make sense that Walt thought Jesse was a voluntary partner with Jack until he saw him in person  it makes more sense that after learning blue meth was still around he deduces Jesse is a meth cooking slave and decides to save him since he felt responsible for his fate since Im sure he no longer blames Jesse for Hanks death and has realised how much his own monstrousinhumane actions led to Hank and Jesses fate  Hey yall just wanna address something thats been bugging me since the series ended First of all would you guys consider something Vince or any authorcreator in general says about their work OUTSIDE of the work itself like an interview canon I mean by the very definition it isnt right The readers interpretation is as valid as the authors and all that jazz  The reason I ask is because iirc Vince has said that Walt was planning to kill Jesse in the season finale but then when Jack brought Jesse out he realised Jesse was a slave being forced to cook meth against his own will and thus decided to tackle him and save him instead of killing him with the rest of the Nazis  This makes 0 sense at all to me Walt is one of the smartest guys ever period The last time he saw Jesse he was being handed over to the ruthless Nazis to be killed and they stated they would interrogate him first to see what info he gave to the DEA Once Walt finds out blue meth is still being cooked how does he make the assumption that Jack and Jesse must have partnered up Jesse was literally at the mercy of Jack  it would make more sense that Jack decided not to kill Jesse so he could useforce him to cook instead  Walt should also have gotten the fucking hint by now that Jesse DOES NOT want to cook he doesnt wanna keep being a bad person he doesnt wanna be involved in this life How could Walt assume Jesse just decided to voluntarily cook for Jack If he was under threat that makes sense but that means he is being held hostage not a willing partner  Also what the hell was Walts plan if he thought Jesse was a partner Hes about to be killed then berates Jack for being partners with Jesse instead of killing him like they agreed upon If Walt seriously thought that was the case wouldnt Jack just be like Yeah were partners thanks for giving him to me you sucker now time to kill you So Walt basically completely fucked up his plans and only got saved because he accidentally hurt Jacks ego by insinuating they were partners  I think this version makes a lot more sense  Walt finds out blue meth is still being cooked he deduces Jesse must be being forced to cook against his will He meets with Jack and theyre about to kill him until he subtly takes a dig at Jacks prideego by insinuating him and Jesse are partners Walt knows since they arent actually partners this will piss Jack off and make him bring Slave Jesse out in order to flaunt his bravado or whatever Now this is the only part that I feel is weak  but as for the reason why Walt does this  he was most likely planning to be killed himself in this massacre and didnt want to risk dying and leaving Jesse trapped in the underground lab for police to find hence why he brings Jesse out so he can be free once the Nazis are dead  I think this makes a lot more sense than the assumption that Walt thought Jesse and Jack were partners  one it adds to the whole vibe of the season finale of Walt planning everything to perfection and tying up all lose ends When Walt handed Jesse over to the Nazis it was because in that moment he blamed Hanks death on Jesse and wanted to get revengemake him suffer After all his time to reflect Im sure he realises that Jesse isnt just an unloyal rat who deserves to be tortured to death and that Walts own monstrous inhumane actions contributed largely to Hank and Jesses fate So once he finds out blue meth is still being cooked it makes a lot of sense that hed deduce Jesse is being forced to cook against his will and that Walt is to blame for it and thus decides not to just kill the Nazis but to save Jesse and help him escape to partially make up for all the wrongs he did to Jesse and everyone else in the meth business  What are you thoughts do you stick with what Vince said about Walts motivations or does this version make more sense thematically and with what we know about the characters Is what Vince said about this in an interview canon or is the interpretation I laid out a valid one,Did Walt actually think Jesse and Jack were partners in the finale up until the point he saw Jesse,4,1,Did Walt actually think Jesse

LondonKush,2019-06-19 00:49:37,0,1,3, Breaking bad fan theory So with the CIAs alleged involvement with narcotics to the theory of the its a common conspiracy theory that the United States government has had some involvement in the black market drug trade in America I have this theory that from episode S5E12 Soft Ball of Malcom in the middle Hal steals information for a job interview from a former navy seal who works in the next cubicle in his office He argues with Lois about the morals of him stealing the interview from his colleague but Lois assures him he has children and to go to the job interview He turns up to a plain white office building that leads to a door with 212 Global Sales Industries he walks into a waiting room where four ominous men dressed in black suits wearing sunglasses are guarding the waiting room and a young girl in a red dress is filling out a form on a clip board on a sofas Hal nervously walks up to her and asks is this where and before he can finish the girl interrupts and says were not supposed to talk Hal says sorry when he notices a slit in one of the walls which has applicants above it The slit is eye level so Hal approaches and looks into it He asks excuse me I he pauses and gazes at something in the room and says three seconds Then a black sack is thrown over his head and hes taken to a secret location The bag is taken off to revel hes in a office which is only lit by a table lamp where a man in a black suit is seated at a desk in front of him The man says to Hal  so I understand you would like to work for us Startled Hal looks around the room frantically trying to figure out where he is and whats going on Hal replies  dddid someone and before he can finish the man says this job is a wonderful opportunity for the right kind of person Good pay three weeks vacation full benefits package plus the knowledge that youre really making a difference Hal looks at him concerned and the man attempts to smile at hal Hal rubs his hands together still startled then suddenly an alarm goes off and gun shots can be heard from outside of the room theyre in Hal looks back then forward then back again alarmed he asks the man  excuse me was this the man immediately interrupts Hal by saying  if you can hold off on your questions until Im finished with mine Number one Do you have a photographic memory Hal replies nervously with I dont think so He then asks  are you allergic to venomous spider bites Which Hal asks how would I know that And finally the man asks do you have an identical twin Hal replies no The man says Ok thats all I have the man leans over his desk and processed to staple a piece of paper to Hals tie that has the number 31 on it Then the man says go next door Theyll make a mould of your face and then we can get started they then proceed to put Hal through tests to measure his health and fitness heart rate etc While a man in a lab coat is throwing something at Hal while he ducks and dodges them The next clip is Hal upside down trying to solve a Rubix cube while fire crackers are thrown at him The next clip is Hal on a hospital bed while alien like probes are inside his mouth ears and rectal area Then finally a man in a black suit is seen carrying Hal outside of the building to the sidewalk He drops Hal down and says  Thank you for your interest sir any feelings of paranoia over the next few days are completely normal he removes his glasses nods at Hal places them back on and walk back into the building Hal then sprints off down the middle of the road For the rest of the episode Hal is extremely paranoid Lois is having an argument with Francis and Malcom Hal walks around nervously Louis asks him to talk to the boys but Hal says  not now Lois I have way too much on my mind like what She asks I think Im an international spy and I dont even know which side Im on I could be a super villain and not even know it Fast forward into the episode Hal goes back to the office where the interview took place but the building is no longer there Its completely gone to Hals sheer disbelief Hal nervously shouts out to the empty space  Thank you for considering me Its very flattering but Ive decided to stay where I am for now if things change Ill let you know He laughs nervously nods and then runs away Thats the last of the sub plot in this episode But with all of this there is a possibility that Walt is in fact Hals clone and that he was a pawn in the US governments on going war with the Cartel And that Hals clone was made to destroy the meth industry And that maybe Mike was actually Walts minder working for CIA  the US government the entire time In breaking bad you see Walt have a midlife crises because of his terminal cancer diagnosis which leads him to eventually become the main source of meth He started off making batches of his own with Jesse at the start but eventually works his way up to working for Gus who had more power in the meth industry than the Mexican cartel did With Guss and Don Eladio Vuentes relationship it wouldnt have been long until the cartel wanted the same money and quality that Gus was producing and would call upon Gus for help in achieving it  In breaking bad you see Gus and Mike kill a majority of the most powerful cartel members which scratches off big names off of the US governments cartel list Walt wasnt involved or present for this but depending on how his and Jesses relationship would of been at that time theres a possibility he could have been present Tuco gets killed The brothers get killed Hector gets killed Gus gets killed All big players in the meth trade and again names that would have been of huge interest for the US government Later on Walt gets involved with  Jack Welker who is the last piece of the meth trade whos producing Blue Ice Jack later kidnaps Jesse and uses him to cook meth Walt figures out a plan to kill the gang and to save Jessie which he does Jessie drives off happy for his new freedom and with whats happened to Jessie myself and Im sure many others doubt hell be doing another cook again Walts left dead on the floor with a satisfied look on his face as officers walk over his body securing the crime scene With his death is the last of the big players in the meth industry And like I stated before I highly doubt with whats happened Jessie will go back to anything meth related So could that be it Could Walt have been some sort of cloned sleeper agent that was created to bring down some of the cartel and to destroy the meth industry within side itself Just a

back again alarmed he asks the man  excuse me was this the man immediately interrupts Hal by saying  if you can hold off on your questions until Im finished with mine Number one Do you have a photographic memory Hal replies nervously with I dont think so He then asks  are you allergic to venomous spider bites Which Hal asks how would I know that And finally the man asks do you have an identical twin Hal replies no The man says Ok thats all I have the man leans over his desk and processed to staple a piece of paper to Hals tie that has the number 31 on it Then the man says go next door Theyll make a mould of your face and then we can get started they then proceed to put Hal through tests to measure his health and fitness heart rate etc While a man in a lab coat is throwing something at Hal while he ducks and dodges them The next clip is Hal upside down trying to solve a Rubix cube while fire crackers are thrown at him The next clip is Hal on a hospital bed while alien like probes are inside his mouth ears and rectal area Then finally a man in a black suit is seen carrying Hal outside of the building to the sidewalk He drops Hal down and says  Thank you for your interest sir any feelings of paranoia over the next few days are completely normal he removes his glasses nods at Hal places them back on and walk back into the building Hal then sprints off down the middle of the road For the rest of the episode Hal is extremely paranoid Lois is having an argument with Francis and Malcom Hal walks around nervously Louis asks him to talk to the boys but Hal says  not now Lois I have way too much on my mind like what She asks I think Im an international spy and I dont even know which side Im on I could be a super villain and not even know it Fast forward into the episode Hal goes back to the office where the interview took place but the building is no longer there Its completely gone to Hals sheer disbelief Hal nervously shouts out to the empty space  Thank you for considering me Its very flattering but Ive decided to stay where I am for now if things change Ill let you know He laughs nervously nods and then runs away Thats the last of the sub plot in this episode But with all of this there is a possibility that Walt is in fact Hals clone and that he was a pawn in the US governments on going war with the Cartel And that Hals clone was made to destroy the meth industry And that maybe Mike was actually Walts minder working for CIA  the US government the entire time In breaking bad you see Walt have a midlife crises because of his terminal cancer diagnosis which leads him to eventually become the main source of meth He started off making batches of his own with Jesse at the start but eventually works his way up to working for Gus who had more power in the meth industry than the Mexican cartel did With Guss and Don Eladio Vuentes relationship it wouldnt have been long until the cartel wanted the same money and quality that Gus was producing and would call upon Gus for help in achieving it  In breaking bad you see Gus and Mike kill a majority of the most powerful cartel members which scratches off big names off of the US governments cartel list Walt wasnt involved or present for this but depending on how his and Jesses relationship would of been at that time theres a possibility he could have been present Tuco gets killed The brothers get killed Hector gets killed Gus gets killed All big players in the meth trade and again names that would have been of huge interest for the US government Later on Walt gets involved with  Jack Welker who is the last piece of the meth trade whos producing Blue Ice Jack later kidnaps Jesse and uses him to cook meth Walt figures out a plan to kill the gang and to save Jessie which he does Jessie drives off happy for his new freedom and with whats happened to Jessie myself and Im sure many others doubt hell be doing another cook again Walts left dead on the floor with a satisfied look on his face as officers walk over his body securing the crime scene With his death is the last of the big players in the meth industry And like I stated before I highly doubt with whats happened Jessie will go back to anything meth related So could that be it Could Walt have been some sort of cloned sleeper agent that was created to bring down some of the cartel and to destroy the meth industry within side itself Just a thought
