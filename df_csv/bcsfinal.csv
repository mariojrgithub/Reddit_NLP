TheresA_LobsterLoose,2019-06-21 02:04:24,0,11,22,Episode 1 with Peter Gould Bob Odenkirk Jonathan Banks amp Minkie Spiro director  In the opening scene with Gene in Omaha after Gene gets out of the hospital and is in the taxi where the driver seems to have IDd him the street that Gene gets out is the same street where Jesses parents house was Not in the show of course because one scene is in Omaha and the other is Albuquerque But theyve been shooting in Albuquerque for so long theyre starting to have trouble with locations overlapping So the director was told to avoid shooting that house  Mikes house in real life was probably built in the late 19th century and theres a block out front thats for getting on and off a horse or carriage  Keri Condon who plays Mikes daughter in law was a jockey in Ireland and raced horses  Mike getting to sit at home he figured hed be able to collect a paycheck and watch baseball But Jonathan Banks said Mike is a Phillies fan and they tanked that year Im not sure if we have a definate date for when season 4 takes place but the worst record I could find for the Phillies for the earlymid 2000s was 2002 when they finished under 500 and 3rd in the division Every other season in the early 00s Philly was pretty decent  Jonathan Banks said hes been drinking Pabst out of the refrigerator in that house for years and if theres any viewers out there who have anything to do with Pabst he figured Those miserable motherfuckers wouldve sent him a 6 pack at some point  EPISODE 2 with Peter Gould Patrick Fabian Michael Mando Mark Johnson Thomas Schnauz writer amp Michelle MacLaren director  In the opening scene we see the doctor that treated Gus in Breaking Bad in the episode after Salud Originally they were going to shoot a much larger scene for this episode that showed how Gus originally met the Doctor at an airport somewhere and how Gus recruited him But it was deemed too big so they left that part for offscreen  Neff Copiers the copy store with the Hummel figurine was empty there was nothing there The show built a business that looks like its been there forever   Theres a scene in this episode with Kaylee on a swing Its a direct callback to Breaking Bad 507 Say my Name the episode where Mike sees Kaylee for the last time They lined up this shot to be the same  Everytime theres a painting on a wall a tattoo or even graffiti it has to be cleared by lawyers for rights  This was the episode with Kims amazing scene in Howards office They basically just talked about how amazing she was nothing we didnt already know I really wished Rhea had been in this episode so she couldve talked about that scene Patrick Fabian did say they rehearsed it but it was nothing like when they shot the scene  Theres a lot more in each episode but those were the highlights So far Ive liked the commentaries from the earlier seasons better But thats probably because they had a lot more Vince Gilligan and Michael McKean Peter Gould is fine in these episodes so far but Vince Gilligan is by far the best Im hoping hes in some of the upcoming episode commentaries Im not sure Im even gonna watch the commentary for episode 3 because none of the

umnothing,2019-05-17 17:46:49,0,4,20,It was stated in many interviews about Better Call Saul before it aired that it would chronicle Saul Goodman and other characters before during and after Breaking Bad Obviously these kinds of ideas change as a show goes on and can be tossed by the wayside and the first four seasons have only taken place prior to Breaking Bad But from what I see here most of us including me are expecting the show to continue into the Breaking Bad timeline with at least a few episodes that take place during   Unless you joined this sub in the last 5 seconds you are aware that in Sauls first episode of Breaking Bad when Walter and Jesse kidnap him and take him to the desert he is worried that it is at the behest of someone named Lalo obviously a throwaway character line that has been worked into the Better Call Saul narrative And you probably also know that in season 4 of Breaking Bad Gus menacingly reminds Hector that the Salamanca name dies with you indicating that Lalo who has been established to be a Salamanca is dead by this time Furthermore in that same scene when listing the names of Salamancas who he has recently killed Gus does not mention Lalo or Eduardo Lalos given name meaning that he most likely died prior to Gus mass assassination Certainly the writers of Better Call Saul are completely aware of all of this and are taking it into account This makes me wonder if Lalo and Sauls feud whatever it may be will be the main focus of the Breaking Bad crossover aspect of Better Call Saul  the midquel part Saul takes care of Lalo in one way or another with Lalo winding up dead before or during the season 4 period of Breaking bad   It would make sense and not be too hamfisted Obviously it would be boring to just rehash all of the stuff that happened in Breaking Bad so theres got to be something that Saul is doing when hes not working with Walt and Jesse something that we didnt see in Breaking Bad Clearly Lalo has got Saul shitting bricks by the time he meets Walt so we know they must meet before then and Saul must do something worth pissing him off It seems like Saul dealing with Lalo as an enemy would be a beautiful way to overlap the two shows without letting Breaking Bad steal the spotlight   Saul and Lalo feuding would continue and conclude a major Better Call Saul storyline its not contrived and it could take up most of Sauls previouslyoffscreen time in the Breaking Bad timeline as Lalo wouldnt need to be dead or missing until nearly the end of season 4 After that its pretty much all about Walt tying up his loose ends and that would take us to Gene pretty quickly It also wouldnt require Walt or Jesse to be in the foreground Itd be a nice way to keep us entertained without relying on Look who it is Walt and Jesse Wee and so far the creators and writers of this show have been delivering without much if any pandering And while this may seem like an obvious decision I think it would still be a satisfying one  Lalo seems in a way to be the Gus of Better Call Saul seemingly undefeatable incredibly powerful intelligent scary and a worthy adversary who cant be easily duped If the writers see him in this way as well pitting him against Saul would be a natural move making Saul feel the need to kill Lalo before Lalo can do the same to him And theyll no doubt come up with some satisfying unpredictable and exciting way of killing him off   Of course Lalo could simply be dead before Saul meets Walt and Saul is merely unaware until afterwards Maybe Saul set up some plan to kill Lalo and is worried that it backfired or something Who knows,Lalo  and Better Call Saul meeting Breaking Bad  a prediction,20,0,Lalo  and Better Call Saul meeting Breaking Bad  a prediction It was stated in many

severed360,2019-05-13 18:40:54,0,18,113,S5 opens with a black and white teaser of Gene as usual he gets home from work turns on the tv and he sees on the news about a massive gang shooting in NM with multiple dead bodies found Roll intro  Back in the present Jimmy is setting up his new office as Saul while trying to maintain a healthy relationship with Kim but Saul will be working with less elderly and more shady clients Gus is trying to figure out how to finish the superlab but Lalo is investigating Mike and discovers his connections to Nacho Then Kim gets in trouble with her Boss at Mesa Verda after their new construction plans violate some building code causing her to lose her job so she decides to stop playing cons with Jimmy and she will tell him One day you are going to need me and I wont be there Mike talks to Nacho about killing Lalo but Nacho says they cant do it alone they call Jimmy but he says he wont help them So theres a shootout where Nacho gets shot again maybe somebody krazy8 gets arrested and in comes Hank to investigate Hank might not be working for the DEA yet maybes hes just a cop  At this point late 2020 we could potentially see the BB movie release But my hope is that its not actually a movie like its not a 2hour theater movie its just like a fullextended episode or 2 of BCS that takes place in the future but with a new title like Breaking Bad Aftermath so people know it comes last Maybe it shows Jesse after he escapes the compound and hes just looking for a safe place to sleep with some flashbacks to a happier time in his life Maybe he drives by sauls office which is all shutdown and searches for HuellKuby with the help of Badger My hope is that this is all just setting up for the final season and it wont be the last time we see an extended future or postbb episode like this  2021  S6 opens with Gene sitting in his living room drinking and acting nervous hes scanning every news station looking for any details regarding the shooting He decides to pick up the phone and calls somebody all we hear him say is yea its me but we dont know who he calls  We see Kim distancing herself from Jimmy but not entirely Shes just burying her head into probono cases and relying on Jimmy to pay the bills Hank is getting close to pinning some crimes on Nacho possibly due to the fact that DomingoKrazy8 becomes an informant so Nacho skips town But nacho wants to bring his Dad and his dad wont listen so he doesnt go too far since many people know his father Eventually Lalo is going to realize that Nacho was involved in Hectors injury so Gus tells Mike he wants Lalo dead I imagine a scene where Mike yells at Jimmy blaming him for Nachos death and saying youre next not really Mikes lying to manipulate him into doing something really bad so that Jimmy will turn the DEA onto Lalo inorder to get him arrested Maybe Jimmy plants drugs on Lalo then Hank gets a promotion and Nacho is able to live peacefully sorta but it actually allows Lalo to return in the future  we also need a cameo of this guy httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvUi8WzX6erH4ampt18shttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvUi8WzX6erH4ampt18s  Another theory of mine I know everybody hates this idea and will downvote me for saying something so stupid lol but it would be interesting if somehow Kim started working forwith Lydia at Madrigal not sure why but better than her dying right lol also I realize I completely left out Howard not sure but I assume he will carry on with HHM or maybe he becomes a meth addict  ya never know lol jks Daniel Wormald should buy a laser tag oh and somewhere in there Jimmy has to get his payout from the sandpiper case allowing him to buy his Cadillac   S6b Theres obviously a lot more that can be filled in because Mike and Gus deserve a big send off for their last appearance onscreen Or maybe their final scene will be Mike staring at security screens and Gus asking Gale if hes ready to cook while eating chicken of course Eventually well probably see a time jump and then Walter walks into Sauls office Id also like to see some more events that take place during BB giving us a different perspective we may not have previously knownrealized like the DEAs investigation of Madrigal I dont know if they could do a full season like that so maybe season6 will get split into 2parts like BBs final season bringing BCS to about 66 episodes slightly more than BB but only if you dont include the movieextra season both these series need 2 major endings one for current main characters and one for future Gene and Jesse theres so much more they could do in a few more years from now  2023  BBBCS Extended Finale Im hoping they do more than just a 2hour movie for BB cause it sounds shallow being just about Jesse on the run I want to see Jesse and Gene reunite after BCS like there should be a final full season after BCS ends that takes place after BB Maybe Gene will ask for Kim to help him and he will give himself in to rescue Jesse for his freedom hes Slippin Jimmy he has to take the fall Maybe Lalo or Nacho return for one last showdown and JesseSaul has to find walts missing money but Lalo is watching them There should be a big court case scene involving Madrigal and walts money with Kim defending Jimmy and Jesse one last time in the court of law before Jimmy goes to prison for embezzling and conspiring Jesse needs to be cleared of all charges to live a normal life I also want to see a funeral for Hank and Maybe the final scene will be Jesse and Badger or Brock running a furniture store and years later Kim and Jimmy come into buy a crib And all of that is going to require more than just 2hours which is why I am hoping the BBmovie rumors turn into a full season named something like Breaking Bad Aftermath or something more interesting  When all is said and done we should be able to watch the series chronologically starting with BCS followed by BB and ending with BBA or we could watch it in production order whichever people prefer Then maybe ina few more years we can get another prequel miniseries or actual 2hour theaterstyle movie starring a young Gus forming his empire in the 80s maybe  the one character we

which direction it will go so Ill say either she leaves or she dies The scam that her and Jimmy ran to set Huell free I think will come back to bite her and she will get disbarred because of it This I think will be the last straw either leading to her departure or her death   ampx200B  Howard  I can see Howard surviving the series I am honestly super intrigued to see what they do with him going forward as I do not have any idea But I dont see them killing Howard Somehow he will survive I think    ampx200B  Nacho  I predict Nacho will survive and he will flee the country with his father using the fake IDs that he has in his house This would be a great way to introduce Robert Forsters disappearer character as he helps Nacho and his dad change their identities and flee to Canada   ampx200B  Lalo  I think Lalo is guaranteed to die In Season 4 of Breaking Bad when Gus taunts Hector over the cartels demise he says The Salamanca name dies with you So to me its pretty clear that Lalo is dead by the time Breaking Bad starts Im thinking Mike will end up killing him as he becomes too big of a threat to Gus operation    ampx200B  Kevin and Paige from Mesa Verde  They will fire Kim once they learn her involvement in the Huell situation They will continue their expansion with Rich Schweikarts help   ampx200B  Werners remaining men  Thats a good question Mike did promise Werner before he died that his men would get to go home but knowing Gus Fring Im not sure if he would let them I can see Mike vouching for them to Gus to honor Werner but then again in order for Mike to become the truly hardened badass that we know from Breaking Bad who was willing to just kill and kill and kill for Gus I think he will end up killing them himself further pushing him to becoming deadly hitman Mike   ampx200B  Rich Schweikart  He will also fire Kim upon being exposed He will work with Mesa Verde and pick up where Kim left off   ampx200B  Ernie  Im not sure if we ever will see Ernie again in the series We havent seen him since Chuck fired him back in early Season 3 and the only time we saw him after that was the karaoke flashback I sure hope we see him at some point just to see what hes up to but I tend to think hell be fine   ampx200B  There are so many characters in Better Call Saul that I could list but I think these will do it for now Id love to hear what you guys think about

OShaunesssy,2019-04-14 02:21:29,0,12,25, Kim Wexler is probably the best written character on Tv She is smart and driven but too trusting and genuinely has fun when she slips along side Slippin Jimmy Some of the best scenes of the whole show involve her most notably her freakout on Howard after Chucks funeral   as someone who grew up as the younger brother to my cool older bro I sympathized a ton with the Jimmy Chuck storyline throughout the first 3 seasons I felt both guys were partially justified in their feelings In fact for most of the show I found myself siding with Chuck as he was the older and more put together and clearly had to put a ton of work prior to HHM Chuck was the good righteous son but his parents always held Jimmy up higher   That scene where you see their mom die is unreal poor Chuck refuses to leave her side and makes sure he is there for her final moments only for her to call only for Jimmy before dying And then poor Jimmy never gets to know his mom called out for him and thinks he just fucked up by not being there when she passed   Jimmy worked hard early on in life at being selfish and drawing a wedge between himself and Chuck and you can almost see why Chuck never thought Jimmys redemption and quest to be a lawyer was genuine Jimmy was a scummy con man most of his life who Chuck even attributes to the downfall of their fathers store    Side note their karaoke scene broke me to tears knowing where their relationship ends up Chucks demise will go down as one of the darkest moments in Tv history in my opinion The thud thud thud before the lantern topples over gives me chills   Howard is my lowkey favorite character He is initially presented as the big antagonist of the show before they reveal Chuck to be behind all of Howards shitty moments and for the most part of season 2 and 3 you can see a weird respect Howard has for Jimmy Their bathroom scene when Jimmy calls him a shitty lawyer is brilliant piece of writing between two guys with so much history Side note Howard only seemed to be in a handful of scenes in season 4 and that made me sad   What shocks me most about this show is that its practically 2 shows One shows the transformation of Jimmy to Saul and the other shows Mikes first footsteps into the criminal underworld I can count on one hand how many scenes Mike and Jimmy have truly shared together and their storylines often feel miles apart The benefit of knowing all this intersects in Breaking Bad makes this an easy watch even if it can be sometimes jarring Mike dissapearing for the last 2 episodes of season 3 was weird   speaking of which Mike is essentially God right He is never wrong and always has a plan even when it seems like he doesnt Welcome mat is used as surveillance art project with the garden hose and Kaylee is actually road spikes chewing gum wrapper is used to jam up parking meter Mike is unreal and if the actor wasnt so damn likable this role may not be as sincere Luckily the actor nails it and you keep rooting for this modern day terminator character    The difference between Mike in Better Call Saul and Mike in Breaking Bad is pretty apparent though Consider how quick Mike is to kill in BB like that scene where he kills those 4 or 5 hitmen in that warehouse He puts them all down without a second thought But if you look at the first 3 or 4 season of BCS and you see a guy who uses killing only as a last resort The lengths he went to in order to not kill Tuco are unreal Its fascinating to watch this get stripped away from Mike throughout the show Eventually he knows what he must do and kills that German guy He wouldnt kill Tuco a degenerate drug addict low life but puts down this sweet old man who never really hurt anyone Mike may be right all the time but watching his fall from corrupt excop to full blown career criminal hitman is insane and a little heartbreaking   also anyone else suspect that all the germans were killed and not just the boss There is no benefit to shipping them all home sans their role model and boss That ends with questions and then I start wondering if the plan was always to kill every construction guy reguardless of their success    The Gus reveal was good as was showing us the origins of the meth lab Seeing all his henchmen and even Gale is crazy considering how fucked up of an ending that everyone meets Gus killing Nachos buddy with the plastic bag was fucking gross and uncomfortable   I kept having a thought throughout the series and it always blew my mind There are scenes where we see Mike and Hector talk to each other or Gus and Mike or Gus and Gale and I cant help but think how all these characters and scenes are gonna be undone by some shitty insecure high school chemistry teacher Mike and Hector sit down for coffee and I immediately think how crazy it is that after all the shit these 2 badass have been through they will both meet their end due to the involvement of one guy One guy that no one knows or can plan for one guy who is probably eating some shitty bacon and eggs at that exact moment Its crazy to think of the effect Walt will have on everything going on in this show   Nacho or Ignacio is fast becoming my favorite character He had such a small and minor role early on that I was wondering why he is main cast but by season 3 you see how important he is to Hectors story Knowing that we never see Nacho in BB Im legitimately terrified for what ever this guys fate is   Chicanary is a masterpiece of television Everyone should watch it as I think it rivals even the best that Breaking Bad has to offer That slow zoom in on Chuck as he breaks down is unreal and perfect Its not as satisfying as you expect cause there is a real sadness to Chucks menral illness   Lalo is clearly being set up as the final big bad of the show Im thinking Sauls apparent fear of him in BB is reason enough to know that although the Mike and Saul storylines feel disconnected they will merge sooner rather than later   Im scared for Kim I dont imagine she does because I feel like Saul would be even more changed from what we see in BB By the end of Season 4 Saul is using his fake name as a lawyer and accepted who he is His monologue to Mike at the end of season 1 about never making that mistake again combined with his speach to that student at the end of Season 4 about how they will never forget what mistakes she made confirm who Saul is as a lawyer I can already see the character from BB in the screen Id imagine Kim dying would fuck him up really badly This leads me to assume Kim will walk away from Jimmy she has to She is smarter than Jimmy and she will see the path he is heading down and she will leave his ass At least this is my hope cause I love her and will be heartbroken if she is killed   I have a ton more thoughts but this is getting too long as it is and I gotta get back to work This show is amazing though and I am in awe of its quality, Spoilers  just

strooticus,2019-02-26 05:27:38,0,24,41,During my sixth or seventh hell I lost count but its still awesome binge of this show toward the end I couldnt help but think of this  According to the unofficial Breaking Bad timelinehttpsbreakingbadfandomcomwikiBreaking_Bad_Timeline and accompanying plot synopsis Walt and Todd cook in Vamonos Pest houses for roughly three months working with Declan and Lydia There are a few items of note here   During the first housecook Walt amp Jesses 50 pounds bring 1379 million after the dealers got their cut If that cut is 30 that means the gross take of the cook is that same 40000 per pound pricepoint for Walts product and they grossed 2 million for that first batch  If Walt is getting exactly that same amount when cooking with Todd  it is later revealed to be about 80 million  and without any extra costs for Todd the Vamonos Pest guys Lydias cut to handle logistics with the Czech Republic she negotiated 30 and still producing a 50pound batch per cook it would take at least 40 cooks in the 3 months to get to that level  Since that number 40 is unrealistic to cover all of the additional fees lets call it 65  thats enough to handle Lydias 30 deal and also pay Todd amp the Vamonos guys  This isnt the point of this post but lets see what those numbers look like 65 cooks  50 pounds per cook  40Kpound gross  130000000 Lydia clears 39 million and while Im sure a good chunk of that goes to the various players in her line of work freight forwarders Czech dealers etc Im sure she kept at least 10 million for herself Todd amp the bug guys also keep about 10 million for their own efforts which is kinda ridiculous for three months worth of work  Regarding that timeline if theyre going to cook 65 batches in 3 months 13 weeks thats 5 batches per week which means the Vamonos guys must have really started ramping up their own bug extermination business simply to provide enough locations for Walt amp Todd to do their business Walt probably had multiple sets of equipment so he could have two or three houses with inprogress batches at once bouncing around from house to house until theyre all finished Insert whatever other assumptions youd like here  Now that all of that is established which may be worth discussing in more detail by itself I wanted to bring up Jesses slave duties with the Nazis and how much money they were sitting on by the time Walt reappears in Albuquerque  First they took most of Walts money Seven barrels with 80 million total  about 1112 million per They left one Barrel for Walt meaning they likely collected about 68 million in the desert  On top of that they had Jesse cooking for them and while he only had one cook site Im willing to bet they werent very kind to him keeping him cooking basically 247 largely so Todd could satisfy his crush on ol Lydia but Im sure the money was a nice bonus too  According to that same timeline Jesse was enslaved by Uncle Jack amp Co for about one week shy of six months so about 25 weeks Even if Jesse was only producing two 50pound batches per week a conservative estimate thats still 2500 pounds with the Nazis keeping every penny after Lydias 30 cut That comes out to an additional 70 million Its entirely possible that this number could be doubled if they kept Jesse working around the clock making that closer to 140 million on top of the 68 they already collected in Ozymandias Those guys dont exactly seem like the kind who are overly concerned with laundering it or investing in Tbills so thats over 200 million total that Jack amp his guys are sitting on  in cash  somewhere in the outskirts of Albuquerque NM  Sure they spent a few bucks on additional compound security and that crazy recliner one of the guys dies on but its all a relative drop in the bucket to the amount of cash on hand Meanwhile Lydia would have grossed another 3060 million for herself so after her costs shes likely worth 2030 million because of this venture before she enjoys her final packet of Stevia  My questionreason for bringing this up holy shit is this accurate Do these numbers add up Plenty of assumptions were taken but after watching this show a halfdozen times Id like to think those assumptions are pretty reliable based on how everything plays out and ties together The total numbers are never brought up and besides Jacks You want your money right Huh You wanna know where it is You pull that trigger youll never   there isnt really any mention of the gigantic amount of exactly how much money has been collected and is sitting somewhere at Jacks compound  Also potentially very related it could possibly be one angle that the upcoming BB movie addresses Im still convinced that Jesse is broken  mentally emotionally physically etc  and doesnt have much time left after his escape before he does something rash but maybe returning to the Nazi compound and collecting 9figures to give to Kaylee Ehrmantraut the family of Drew Sharp some college scholarship fund named after Gale the Rocket Man Endowment Fund his narcotics anonymous group or whatever else he pleases If it was out in the open surely the cops would seize it when they appeared at the end of

driving drunk home from Chucks the night be brought over the 35 year old Macallan Remember the screenshot of him sitting outside Chucks house at night the shadows of the tree branch looking like a scar across this face Considering his depressed state in Season 4 and very occasional appearances despite his seeing an emotional upswing at the finale of Season 4 I would doubt very much Howards demons regarding Chucks death and his self imposed guilt about it has been fully kept at bay   It would make sense that Howard is overwhelmed by the full responsibility of the firm falling squarely on him and coupled with the guilt of Chucks suicide would be entirely plausible that Howard starts drinking more heavily Weve seen how he keeps cabinets of fine scotches and whiskeys around the office and enjoys a drink to celebrate but maybe it starts with helping him sleep per the mentioned insomnia Maybe he has a win at the office in which he on the one hand feels like the firm is finally getting its old reputation back on the other hand the victory feels hollow as he cant escape the guilt of Chucks death So he drinks and drinks more than usual Drives home Pulled over Maybe to make matters even worse attempts to bribe the cop into letting this slide Hes arrested  Now facing jail time and his own disbarment HHM has completely fallen down the tubes No lawyer will come to Howards aid Kim would but her bosses at SampC wont have it Not good for the image So she talks Jimmy into taking it He could make a positive name for himself Jimmy doesnt want to but takes Howards case at Kims urging Howard is grateful but still cant let get his head out of his own ass Maybe he makes a crack about Saul Goodman sounding like an ambulance chaser Maybe he says something else And Jimmy remembers everything he hates about Howard His bootlicking of Chuck The Gollum comment Comes to decide that if HHM desolves he can get his settlement money sooner or even a bigger slice of the pie Throws Howards case in court in spectacular nonSaul or Jimmy savvy fashion Uncharacteristically unprepared or perhaps just doesnt defend even acts like a secondary prosecutor Im not a lawyer so Im fuzzy on details on how it would play out Regardless Howard faces charges Is disbarred HHM is done for Maybe this is what drives Kim to be so disgusted by Jimmy she is completely done with him She sees him as being completely driven by the wrong reasons and everything she found admirable in him is gone  Howard never works in law again HHM is gone Jimmy gets a large cut of the settlement to bankroll the Saul office  If you want a Heisenberg moment maybe the last thing Jimmy says to Howard is revealing he ruined his own career over misplaced guilt because it was he who blew the whistle on Chucks mental illness to the insurance providers in the first place  Idk Just a thought Not everyone dies a fiery death,Theory on Howard in Season 5,16,0,Theory on Howard in Season 5 Posting on mobile

deadfly1,2019-01-27 09:20:17,0,1,0,I cant write the FULL plot but considering whoever reads this knows what happens Ill just speculate the whole Episode  The episode begins with Mike going to the church seeing as the church needs money for activities and other things but only gives a twenty to get them away from him and make Stacy happy  As the seasons goes through Lalo is becoming more aggressive and demanding in the business trying to take the top spot currently held by Nacho Lalo ends up manipulating Tio into taking the front end from Nacho meanwhile as Nacho doesnt care that he has the front end Lalo keeps a close eye on Nacho and wants him by his side most of the time This makes fleeing harder for Nacho but wants to get it done not just quickly but in the best way he possibly can do so  Nacho goes over to visit Saul as he remembers him as a reasonable man In a previous episode Lalo gets involved with Saul as Nacho manages to tag along telling him all that happened with Tio and his stroke etc Nacho tells him that he rigged Tios medication and explains how hes in the middle and the whole reason that happened was because he didnt want his Dad to get involved in the life hes stuck in Nacho says to Saul If there is any way you could find an easy way for me to flee the country without being traced Ill pay extra money just make it happen I know what these men are capable of the moment they find me Im dead look I dont care about me its my father that matters more here because he didnt sign up for this but me whether I like it or not Im stuck As Nacho leaves Saul thinks about how he should add as much connections as possible as he knows he has the power to make any problem go away without any problems now  Mike is called in to talk with Saul about what kind of criminal connections he could possibly have and Mike gives a huge list of things people would like but are illegal to get a hold of how he might be able to get some but would be lots of work to do  Nacho is currently finding a way to get Lalo off his back and at the same time to give Gus less of a worry in order to not have Nacho in his thoughts   Saul finally gets a connection from Ed for the clandestine service of taking people gives him his card and tells him all the details on what to do Moments after Ed leaves he writes down all the info to give to Nacho on what to do before giving him a call Nacho picks up the phone to Saul telling him that he could help him with all of his problems As Nacho knows he cant leave the cartel he tries to think of what he could do so that nobody knows about what happened to him or his Dad  that is left a mystery for now throughout the series to be found out in the next episode Nacho intentionally works up Lalo in order to make him seem like the big boy and show Gus who the boss truly was Lalo calls Nacho to meet with Gus to get what he wants  They head out to the Factory Farm to meet up with Gus Lalo steps in the room with confidence thinking he was going to leave the meeting the bigger man showing the family how valuable he truly believes he is Lalo breaks a rule everybody in that room witnesses showing Lalo hes the only guy in that very room and Gus is very angry He takes a slight look at Nacho showing that he truly is angry Nacho knows something is about to go down and looks very nervous meanwhile Lalo looks confident that hes still the big boy Gus walks over to Lalo very politely basically showing him what true manners look like He grabs a cup of coffee later sneaking in poison and hands it right over to Lalo Lalo enjoys the coffee but just as Gus stages a discussion he falls to his death Gus looks right at Nacho and says He broke the one rule anybody should never break and crossed the one line that should never be crossed He looks back at Tyrus and Victor and says Clean up this mess then looks at Nacho and says Get yourself some rest  Saul continues on with the day figuring out what kind of connections hed need in terms of crime He manages to get many more some of which with the help of Mike  The moment Nacho gets home he tells his Dad everything that happened telling him that they need to leave no time to ask questions sell the business pack up everything and go Nacho and his father flee away to Winnipeg  The episode ends with Mike being called into Sauls office giving Mike a big bonus as he wouldnt have gone this far if it werent for him Mike cashes the check not knowing what to do with it then sees that he could give it to the church  Executive Producers  Vince Gilligan

ultimately triggered the final steps of his evolutiondevolution into fullon unencumbered Saul Goodman Ive been compiling these thoughts since the end of season four They are primarily about the brothers relationship to one another how it affected Jimmy and how he dealt with those feelings I felt the need to write this all down for a few reasons First of all I dont know anyone who watches this show and its a show that I really need to unpack Its an amazing and complex story that stirs up real emotions inside of me and I cant talk to anybody about it Secondly I thought it could be a useful or at least fun read for people who have similar thoughts but havent had the chance to sit down and parse them out Lastly Im a writer by nature and this is how I have to organize the thoughts

sort of something to have over his conniving brother Chuck agreed to help Jimmy and Jimmy accepted Chucks offer of a job in the mailroom The two estranged brothers were now tied to one another This was both brothers biggest mistake   Jimmys announcement to Chuck that he had passed the New Mexico bar and was able to practice law was an issue with Chuck for multiple reasons Sure Chuck probably wished his brother would not cause much excitement and continue to work beneath him But on a deeper level Chuck has spent a lifetime building a career in the legal field and takes himself and his profession incredibly seriously Jimmy gets a degree from a joke of a school passes the bar on this third try then has the audacity to suggest he should be made a partner Not only that but now Jimmy with or without HHM is going to be a practicing lawyer and member of the legal community in the same city as Chuck Chucks reputation is now on the line potentially vulnerable to ridicule at the hands

only be used as a weapon against them by the other So they keep it all to themselves  As much of a threat to Chucks lifestyle Jimmy is Chuck is also a threat to Jimmys lifestyle His lifestyle of skirting the rules taking shortcuts and getting ahead the easy way that is Chuck is the only person in Jimmys life who truly sees the full scope of who Jimmy is Hes seen the consistent pattern of Jimmys behavior from childhood to adulthood how he never really puts in any real amount of effort to become a sincere trustworthy person and Jimmy knows this Chuck sees through to his core and is so disgusted by it that he will go through any amount of trouble to prove it to those around him and Jimmy knows this Jimmy went to the copy store to bribe the clerk just based on the intuition that Chuck would go there to snoop Chuck was willing and able to expose any lie Jimmy tried to maintain and that is a major threat to who Jimmy is   So when Chuck develops his disorder and becomes a recluse finally Jimmy can breathe a little In fact both of them can Its probably the most symbiotic the two brothers have ever been Chuck can wield his disorder over Jimmy to get him to run little errands and be sympathetic and Jimmy gets to feel like a good little brother for obliging Jimmy doesnt have to worry about Chuck meddling in his affairs and Chuck has an excuse to remain blissfully ignorant of any illicit business Jimmy may be involved in But of course this unhealthy codependence couldnt last long   What happens next is a complex series of events each one feeding naturally into the other eventually culminating in  major spoiler alert  Chucks suicide The two brothers who shouldnt have been in each others lives at all had thrust themselves headfirst into a closer relationship and it was a grave mistake Now Jimmy is left with some complicated feelings He had lost his brother in the midst of a nasty spat Chuck wanting to seem strong and unaffected by what Jimmy had done decided to tell Jimmy To tell you the truth you never really mattered all that much to me And while we can see that Jimmy mattered a lot to Chuck in a brotherly way maybe but definitely in a negative sense Jimmy probably took that statement at face value Another thing for the brothers to swallow push down ignore And then Chuck is gone To make matters worse here comes Howard to unload his baggage about the insurance This statement did two things to Jimmy for one it revealed to him that he played a part a big part in what triggered Chucks relapse and suicide no doubt sparking a pang of guilt inside Jimmy However it also gave Jimmy a sort of scapegoat for this guilt  Howard So thats the first thing that stood out to me I had wondered why Jimmy went from being sullen to being glib and aloof He had a lot dumped on his lap by Howard and so he gave a little jab to Howard Well Howard I guess thats your cross to bear and begins making a pot of coffee No tears no anger nothing Just put on a phony façade and ignore the issues at hand Its been working well for him so far   The next strange behavior from Jimmy is when he goes in for his infamous interview at Neff Copiers He gets the job immediately after putting on a hokey little songanddance and is amazed that it worked as well as it did Hes almost blown away This is the first time he really realizes the power he has over people like really sees it happen before him He couldnt take the job the first job hes had working for someone other than a client since he became a lawyer because he had no respect for the people he would have been working for Hell they didnt even notice that they had little tchotchke worth thousands of dollars just sitting on a shelf A tchotchke which Jimmy uses as a happy distraction from everything else going one a smalltime lame stunt for someone like Jimmy to pull Mike sees this and tells Jimmy as much Its not for me and I dont think it should be for you  Then we get to Chucks letter Lots of people looked way too deep into this one but from what I see its much simpler The letter from Chuck is pretty cut and dry Its a nice little letter nothing special and I think he meant most of what he said to Jimmy Nothing in the letter is so mushygushy that it warranted a big reaction from Jimmy except for the fact that it was written by his dead brother so thats where the emotions hinge The letter does make mention of the day Jimmy was born and being so special to Mother  an indication that Chuck still dwells on the favoritism that was given to Jimmy At any rate the degree to which Chuck was being genuine in the letter is more or less irrelevant  Jimmy is far from sentimental either way and refuses to let anything regarding his brother affect him in any way This sets the tone for the entirety of Jimmys reaction to Chucks death Jimmys heart is hardened fully a process that has been happening over the years and is now complete Kim sees this but doesnt realize the degree to which Jimmy has allowed his heart to harden She doesnt yet realize that his emotions have become obstacles to him to be avoided and destroyed or how this new Jimmy may not be able to tend to their relationship any longer This is very a very real thing that happens to people and its amazing to watch play out   Next we have Kim deciding to practice alone and telling Jimmy that she doesnt want to create WexlerMcGill any longer This is a really big blow to Jimmy who had been counting on this to be his future after he gets reinstated All at once he realizes that she is past that shes a genuine lawyer an upstanding and careerdriven person who has no need to partner with him in the same way that he needs to partner with her  to give himself some legitimacy No more Kim by his side shes a big shot now While this is a huge blow he cant let it faze him not this late in the game Things get better when she and Jimmy pull a couple more cons together bringing them closer and reminding them of the excitement they can create for and with one another But still Jimmy cant deny the fact that they are on different playing fields For Jimmy pulling cons is a lifestyle and passion For Kim its a hobby nothing more than a dirty secret These realizations leave Kim Wexler hanging by a thread in the life of Jimmy McGill   Every emotional development that Jimmy has undergone in season four climaxes in the full realization of the shows titular character Saul Goodman When Jimmy goes in for his reinstatement interview he puts on a little songanddance in the same variety of the one he gave months earlier at Neff Copiers After seeing the powers he had really play out and work he assumes it should work the same way again and so he fills his interview with folksy clichés and cheesy charm The board however sees through it easily and docks him for his lack of sincerity withholding his reinstatement and if they had done anything else it would have tarnished the shows integrity   This realization that sincerity is his missing ingredient is what sends Jimmy into full throttle sociopathy His hardened heart which he no longer allows to feel real emotion must now learn to manufacture sincerity This has been something Jimmy has had inklings of in the past but he only used it to swindle people out of petty cash or woo clients small stuff Now he must fake a moving speech trot out emotions act as though he were really experiencing them and say exactly what he knows they want to hear He borrows those emotions which have been tamped down all of his feelings towards Chuck and uses them to his advantage Emotions he once viewed as obstacles he has now learned to use as tools to persuade or dupe others  clever but sickening Once this sociopathy has fully enveloped him he is no longer the innocent character weve been watching all this time Kim believes hes back himself again as tears well up in her eyes watching him bear what hes convinced everyone is a soul But as soon as hes out of that room she realizes that what she thought was a breakthrough was actually another swindle What could have been a breakthrough was instead just a severe emotional manipulation Were left with the face of a devastated and confused Kim Wexler as Jimmy tells her that its all good man   Up to this point weve seen Jimmy McGill resemble Saul Goodman in many ways their flair their tackiness their creativity their knack for exploitation Weve seen the ingredients pop up here and there Jimmys colorful suits characters like Huell and Francesca Jimmys knack for keeping criminals out of jail But throughout Jimmy has had heart Hes been somebody to root for In the shows parent series Breaking Bad the leading man began as a sympathetic character but devolved into pure evil relatively quickly leaving the viewers to instead root for those around him Jimmy has been sympathetic enough all the way through Even now that hes become Saul Goodman were still rooting for him hoping he comes out okay and doesnt hurt anyone too badly Hes a bad guy but hes really not a bad guy to borrow a phrase But he is now the character we knew he would be going in the character that inspired the series after all

of Jimmy McGill and the Evolution of Saul Goodman  SPOILERS ,54,0,The Emotional Life of Jimmy McGill and the Evolution of Saul Goodman  SPOILERS  I have been trying to work on some important work for my job but keep wasting time by writing my assessment of Jimmy McGills relationship to his brother and how it ultimately triggered the final steps of his evolutiondevolution into fullon unencumbered Saul Goodman Ive been compiling these thoughts since the end of season four They are primarily about the brothers relationship to one another how it affected Jimmy and how he dealt with those feelings I felt the need to write this all down for a few reasons First of all I dont know anyone who watches this show and its a show that I really need to unpack Its an amazing and complex story that stirs up real emotions inside of me and I cant talk to anybody about it Secondly I thought it could be a useful or at least fun read for people who have similar thoughts but havent had the chance to sit
