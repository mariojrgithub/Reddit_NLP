5,duckythegunner,2019-07-06 22:57:11,0,11,170,"I started watching BB in February one episode per day with taking a break between seasons just to relive the experience of those who used to watch it week by week and keep watching it as long as i can, and the show never disappointed me, it was so good that it made me interested in chemistry.

Everything about it was perfect, even though it didn't run for long, yet it still crushed it in every way possible, the story, writing, acting, cinematography, directing, production, all of that was top quality, it's hard to find a production team so consistent &amp; dedicated to their work, no wonder this is the most critically acclaimed show of all time.

and though I've accidentally seen every major spoiler in the show (and i swear i wasn't asking for it, it was the fucking social media) it surpassed my expectations every single time.

About the cast, everyone made a great performance, especially the Whites, the characters were so realistic and well written, they made BB my biggest joy in the past few months, even though i wanted to see more of some characters like gus fring (great villain by the way), and i want to take a moment to praise the outstanding performance of Bryan Cranston, i still can't comprehend the fact that he was a comedy actor, thanks to his great talent, Walter White is my all time favorite character in TV, never seen anyone like him and probably will never see again, i hope that i'm wrong.

Part of the journey is the end, oh that finale, it was the most satisfying ending in history, hands down, made me love this show more that ever, right now i feel a little bit empty after the end, this show has set the bar too high for everyone else, in the end i realized, it was all in the chemistry, this show will live in my memory forever. 10/10",Just finished Breaking Bad an hour ago and i must say it one of the best shows I've ever seen.,170

This causes all kinds of problems for her, and she eventually has to pay his back taxes herself using Walt’s drug money.

My question is, why the hell did she agree to cook his books in the first place? Ted wasn’t paying her off or anything, so I don’t see what her motive was, especially since this was the first serious criminal act she commits in the show. She must have known that Ted would probably get caught and it would lead back to her. Why would she not just quit working for Ted and avoid getting wrapped up in this huge crime?

26,retrolegend,2019-07-06 21:03:10,0,12,2,"I'm rewatching bits and pieces of the last few episodes but it just occurred to me that Walt really told Hank to ""tread lightly"" when Hank discovered the truth about Walt. All I knew before was that the entire scene and speech from Walt was so amazing, but now that I'm rewatching it and I'm starting to think that ""tread lightly"" was an empty threat.

Why? Because when Saul implied that Walt should kill Hank, Walt got mad and refused to do anything of the sort. Then, when Jack was getting ready to kill Hank, Walt begged him not to. And finally, when Skyler accused him of killing Hank, Walt swore that he didn't and that he tried to save him. Sounds like Walt never wanted Hank to get hurt or die, which is obviously true.

So if that's true, then did Walt tell Hank to ""tread lightly"" just to scare him? Was it an empty threat? Do you guys think Walt really would have done something to Hank if push came to shove? If he never wanted Hank to die etc. then what good was the threat?

It's all very sentimental and a very sweet moment, and totally heartbreaking when contrasted with the Jesse at that moment.

My problem with it is that, in Breaking Bad's own canon, it could never have happened.

The first time the museum is brought up is in ""Four Days Out"" (S2E09), but Jesse has to bail on the plans to go because he's been called into the desert by Walt to cook.

The next time the museum is brought up is in ""Mandala"" (S2E11), and this time Jesse brings up the idea of going but Jane is only interested in smoking meth now that she fell off the wagon. After this point all of her and Jesse's actions are pretty much accounted for-- they hang out and get high together pretty much constantly until Jane dies. I don't have a lot of faith that these two junkies would clean up their act for an afternoon, Jesse would stop being sad over Combo's death and his own guilt in it, and drive an hour both ways to Santa Fe.

To start, the song’s story is very similar to Walt’s in the last episode. The main character of ‘El Paso’ falls in love with a girl named Felina and challenges a man to a bar duel that he sees flirting with Felina. He kills the man, and steals a horse and runs to New Mexico. He can not forget his love for Felina, and returns to her where there are lawmen waiting for him. He gets shot in his side and later in his chest and dies in Felina’s arms. 
I just thought the mirroring of events between the song and the last episode was interesting, and i thought you guys would feel the same.",I am just now realizing the significance of ‘El Paso’ by Marty Robbins in Felina,15

She was my favorite character in the show -complex, layered, conflicted. She was written and acted with so much depth and nuance. And most of the audience hated her?

I loved watching the anger with her husband after catching him in a massive lie, realizing it was meth, refusing him, coming to an understanding that it was about family, trying to help by making the financial situation more protected, leveling with Walter, worried for her family’s safety, and eventually giving up. It’s one of the most complex arcs I’ve seen in a character. 

One of my favorite moments was when Ted asks her what Walt did to her so he doesn’t make the same mistake, and she just pauses and says “I’d be amazed.” Or when she’s drinking wine by the bottle at dinner with Jesse and Walter. The nuance in it is incredible.

We were watching TV and talking about how there was nothing on, when my 88-year-old gran starts telling me about what she was watching on Netflix last night. ""Bad something, bad... bad..."". She couldn't remember so I put Netflix on. ""BREAKING BAD!""

She said that she loved it and that even though it's very violent, she also found it very funny. She watched the first 5 episodes and said that the bathtub falling through the ceiling was hilarious.

My grandparents is a pretty reserved people, and they normally watch ITV dramas and gameshows, so I thought it was pretty funny.

The city and state wear this show on it's shoulder. So I believed that everyone just loved the show because of the setting, but then 2 weeks ago I broke down and gave it a watch. This is seriously the fastest I have ever watched a series because I way prefer films to tv shows, but I would end up watching 5-6 episodes a day sometimes, I felt personal connections to the characters and of course the setting, it's crazy because I used to have chemistry in the class they used for Walt's classroom. I loved mapping out where all the characters are. But the show was so perfectly written, and Jesse has to be one of my favorite characters in literature, and I loved it because they treat the characters like real people who make real mistakes, like how for most of season 5 I actually disliked Walt. One of my favorite shows ever is the office and the series finale was so sad because you feel like there could have been more but with breaking bad you just see everything come full circle by the end, and as Walt gets over himself and accepts his own mortality you come to accept the end of the series.

When do you think Mike started to respect Jesse?  The obvious one is the Mexico when Jesse cooked the batch of 96 percent purity and saved Mikes life.  You could also say earlier in Season 4 when Jesse handled the meth heads who stole the product.  One theory ive also heard is back in Season 3 when Jesse stood up for Tomas.

Through comments to people about people, critiquing everyone, yadda yadda, we all know how she is. But I just noticed the purple thing, yeah it's season five and it took me forever to notice, shame shame. But I was thinking. Purple is the color of royalty because it was so costly to produce, and only the rich, such as Kings and Queens, could afford purple dyed clothing. I'm thinking there's a correlation there, because Marie definitely thinks she's better than everyone else. Maybe purple symbolizes something else, but that was the first thing to pop into my head when I saw all of the purple.

So after Marie gets the call from Hank that Walter is “dead to rights” (lmaooooo) she immediately becomes even more smug than she usually is since her husband ‘won’. But that’s not even the part that bothers me as that’s part of Marie’s character. What pisses me tf off is that Marie is on her moral high ground and basically coerces Skyler to tell Walter Jr about Walt’s Heisenberg persona. Skyler was emotionally vulnerable in a state of distress and Marie felt superior and thought she knew what was best. That was not the time nor place to tell Walter Jr about Walt’s Heisenberg side. Hank should have been there when they told him and it should not have been at the fucking car wash. Obviously Walter Jr was going to flip out regardless  but hearing it from Hank would have been a bit easier as he could’ve explained it better. 

That obviously wouldn’t have happened since...yk...but it should have played out that way in the moment. Skyler and Marie later finding out that Hank was killed would’ve been a better time to tell him as then Walter would’ve been seen as a threat to anyone he cared about.

Earlier they spent almost 20 minutes in the desert when Jesse left the key in the ignition and that was amazing. But this was something else. What was the point of this ? Walt apologized to Jesse about Jane...When in reality Walt has nothing to do with her death and even warned Jesse about taking the money.

Same episode, when walt is making the pro/con list hes sitting on the toilet where he just flushed out the human slurpee and he has his pants down... Hes actually taking a dump while pondering the morality of murder! Nice sensitivity man!!!
Finally, fourth episode, hank says the meth they found in crazy 8 car is 99,1% pure, i thought walt wasnt able to reach such purity until much later with the super laboratory from gus, isnt it ludicrous to have that much quality on his first cook in a van?

Everyone I've asked about this has said the bullet went through his back, but there's several shots of his back afterwards and it's clean.
I've always thought that there was just no real explanation for the bullet wound and it was a genuine error (the only one I ever found in the show). But, I've just watched it again and noticed that jesse had clear access to walt's stomach.

If anything, I noticed more details this time that made Walt all the more sympathetic and, if not justified, at least rational in his actions.

But then I got to Season 5. All of a sudden, it's like I'm watching a completely different person! But thanks to all the fantastic character development Walt's had over the past 4 seasons, it's totally believable that he would become as ruthless as Gus was right after killing him.

Still, the level of sociopathy that Walt is displaying right now is terrifying. I just finished the third episode (Hazard Pay), and Walt does multiple things that seem like reincarnations of past Breaking Bad villains:

– When Skyler is recovering from her mental breakdown, rather than check up on her, Walt just heads to the kitchen, grabs an apple, and takes a big, satisfying bite out of it. This is what one of the cartel twins did while the other one murdered a police officer.

– His manipulation of Jesse is just as subtle and unemotional as Gus's. At the end of the episode, when Jesse reveals that he's broken up with Andrea (which Walt manipulated him into doing), Walt doesn't even react to the news – he just immediately moves on the next order of business, which is killing Mike.

It is so obvious that Walt is the villain now that I can't believe I didn't see it the first time. The main story of these past few episodes (maybe even the past few seasons) is that Walt is destroying the lives of all the people he supposedly cares about. And the main question seems to be whether he's such a megalomaniac that he doesn't even notice this (his interactions with Skyler seem to imply this), or he does notice it, but doesn't care because subconsciously he already knows that he's doing this all for himself. I'm curious to hear which of these you guys think it is.

My view of Walt has changed so much that Season 5 feels almost like a completely new season this time. I can't wait to finish it and see how this impacts my views on the final episodes and the series as a whole.",_____'s transformation after Season 4,21

Simply put, Acids are used for dissolving inorganic minerals while Bases are used for organic compounds. Lye, or NaOH/Sodium Hydroxide, is used as a drain cleaner and is a very strong base, making it a whole lot easier to dissolve flesh and it wouldn’t eat through Jesse’s bathtub, floor, and ceiling.

Despite being spoiled countless amounts of things (Mikes death, Hank being killed by Jack), and watching Walters death scene way back in 2013 on YouTube, it was still phenomenal. The character arcs were great, especially Jesse’s. I will say, I did like Walter all the way up until the point where he still had Jack take Jesse away to kill, and to add insult to injury, had to mention how he watched Jane die. Was also sad that Jesse didn’t say “bitch” in the final episode. I really wished they made a spin-off series on Jesse, because I really want to know what happens with his life, and a 2 hour movie will not do that justice. I’m glad that they ended the show on a “happy” note, where Walter at least accepted his fate, because now I won’t be as sad, like I was with Arthur’s death in Red Dead Redemption 2.

But in his last moments, he should've seen that Walt had some humanity left. That Walt would rather turn himself in that sic Jack and his goons on Hank.

After all this was a man who he thought of as the enemy who was trying to save his life.

For me, Breaking Bad is all about the characters. It explores every relationship, every feeling, every personality. You know, people are complex, and the person we show to others isn't the same person that we are inside. Breaking Bad manages to show that person inside of every main character.

* **Walter White** is a confusing character, and I think I know why. The show made me like him from episode 1, it manipulates the viewer into thinking the character is good and loveable. That's why even after he does disgusting things, I still kinda feel in his side. And it's amazing how they do it. Even throughout the entire last season I still feel favorable for him. Breaking Bad tells its story from Walter's point of view, and that just makes very one-sided.

* **Jesse Pinkman** is, well, he's such an emotional and heartbreaking character. He's the good kid in a wrong world. It reminds me of that occasional person you talk to, whose first impression might portray a junkie or a person of bad habits, but when you talk with them, they seem like the nicest person in the world. Jesse is a victim of the cruel world, it always feels like he's out of place and for the viewer, it's so sad to see him suffer when he really doesn't deserve.

* **Skyler White** is weird for me. I really don't like her. Maybe it's because of what I said before. In the end of the day, she's kind of a rival to Heisenberg. But I think it's more complex than that. In the White family, the victims are actually the children, not Skyler and obviously not Walter. She's the mom who always wants to assert her dominance over everyone, always wants to be on command and always wants to rule. For me, it's just anoying. Don't get me wrong, it's a great character because it portrays that idea really well.

* **Mike**, oh Mike. Mike is one of my favorite characters. He's the guy. I can't even describe him, he's just the guy that's above everything, the guy who's there and who no-one messes with, but a guy who's actually reasonable and level-headed. The acting is also on point.

* **Gus Fring** is mind-blowing. It seems that only Walter could really catch up to his level of caution and intelligence. He always has the answer, always pervented, always one step ahead. It's really cool to watch him. It's also interesting that he never reveals emotion until Walter is an actual threat to him.

There are much more that deserve a deep analysis and we could spend years talking about how these characters are and how they interact. These were the ones I wanted to comment on. I also wanted to say something about Saul but I think it's already long enough. I'm looking foward for his spin-off, though, I actually love his character!

He left an awful lot to chance by having Walt come and go every day.

However, maybe that would have caused undue inconvenience for Walt and would have made the situation untenable, MAYBE.  But certainly after Walt had Gale killed, Gus had no real reason to care anymore.  And he had every reason to want to isolate Walt, both from Jesse and from having the ability to hatch his plans.

I feel like it would have made a lot more sense to strike a deal with Walt for his life and the safety of his family (not to mention his continued salary) to agree to basically live on site and spend all of his time cooking.  Or to do the same even without Walt's full agreement.  It's not as if Walt would be all that opposed anyway given the alternatives.

Basically I just don't think Gus's strategy of trying to keep Walt in line through sheer intimidation was the best move.

So the season is now Walt vs DEA. Then comes part 2 where Walt starts to lose everything. This should be started by Walt failing in his attempts to convince Jack to not fight back against the DEA. Walt tries to reason saying that “if the DEA comes in full force we’re all in jail so dont provoke the sleeping bear” but in reality he’a just protecting Hank. With the DEA coming too close to catching Walt (ie Jessie switching sides) Jack’s crew says screw it we have to take some action. Causing Hank to die, and the rest of the events in the last couple episodes go the same way except now Jack had an entire season of buildup, and Walt’s ultimate undoing would be going too far trying to get more power

448,firefistzoro,2019-06-19 11:13:48,0,16,4,"**TLDR; Walt handed Jesse to the Nazis to be killed. Once Walt finds out blue meth is still around, a smart man like Walter will surely deduce that Jesse is being forced to cook against his will (especially since he knows how badly Jesse wants to get out of that life). The theme of the finale was Walt being a ghost/shadow/Christ like figure, planning everything to perfection and tying up lose ends. It doesn't make sense that Walt thought Jesse was a voluntary partner with Jack until he saw him in person - it makes more sense that after learning blue meth was still around, he deduces Jesse is a meth cooking slave and decides to save him since he felt responsible for his fate (since I'm sure he no longer blames Jesse for Hank's death, and has realised how much his own monstrous/inhumane actions led to Hank and Jesse's fate).**

Hey y'all, just wanna address something that's been bugging me since the series ended. First of all, would you guys consider something Vince or any author/creator in general says about their work OUTSIDE of the work itself (like an interview) canon? I mean by the very definition, it isn't, right? ""The reader's interpretation is as valid as the author's"" and all that jazz.

The reason I ask is because iirc, Vince has said that Walt was planning to kill Jesse in the season finale, but then when Jack brought Jesse out, he realised Jesse was a slave being forced to cook meth against his own will, and thus decided to tackle him and save him instead of killing him with the rest of the Nazis.

This makes 0 sense at all to me. Walt is one of the smartest guys ever, period. The last time he saw Jesse, he was being handed over to the ruthless Nazis to be killed, and they stated they would interrogate him first to see what info he gave to the DEA. Once Walt finds out blue meth is still being cooked, how does he make the assumption that Jack and Jesse must have partnered up? Jesse was literally at the mercy of Jack - it would make more sense that Jack decided not to kill Jesse so he could use/force him to cook instead.

Walt should also have gotten the fucking hint by now that Jesse DOES NOT want to cook, he doesn't wanna keep being a bad person, he doesn't wanna be involved in this life. How could Walt assume Jesse just decided to voluntarily cook for Jack? If he was under threat, that makes sense, but that means he is being held hostage, not a willing partner.

Also, what the hell was Walt's plan if he thought Jesse was a partner? He's about to be killed, then berates Jack for being partners with Jesse instead of killing him like they agreed upon. If Walt seriously thought that was the case, wouldn't Jack just be like ""Yeah, we're partners, thanks for giving him to me you sucker, now time to kill you."" So Walt basically completely fucked up his plans, and only got saved because he accidentally hurt Jack's ego by insinuating they were partners?

I think this version makes a lot more sense - Walt finds out blue meth is still being cooked, he deduces Jesse must be being forced to cook against his will. He meets with Jack and they're about to kill him, until he subtly takes a dig at Jack's pride/ego by insinuating him and Jesse are partners. Walt knows since they aren't actually partners, this will piss Jack off and make him bring Slave Jesse out in order to flaunt his bravado or whatever. Now this is the only part that I feel is weak - but as for the reason why Walt does this - he was most likely planning to be killed himself in this massacre, and didn't want to risk dying and leaving Jesse trapped in the underground lab for police to find, hence why he brings Jesse out so he can be free once the Nazis are dead.

I think this makes a lot more sense than the assumption that Walt thought Jesse and Jack were partners - one, it adds to the whole vibe of the season finale, of Walt planning everything to perfection and tying up all lose ends. When Walt handed Jesse over to the Nazis, it was because in that moment, he blamed Hank's death on Jesse and wanted to get revenge/make him suffer. After all his time to reflect, I'm sure he realises that Jesse isn't just an unloyal rat who deserves to be tortured to death, and that Walt's own monstrous, inhumane actions contributed largely to Hank and Jesse's fate. So once he finds out blue meth is still being cooked, it makes a lot of sense that he'd deduce Jesse is being forced to cook against his will, and that Walt is to blame for it, and thus decides not to just kill the Nazis but to save Jesse and help him escape; to partially make up for all the wrongs he did to Jesse and everyone else in the meth business.

What are you thoughts, do you stick with what Vince said about Walt's motivations, or does this version make more sense, thematically and with what we know about the characters? Is what Vince said about this in an interview canon, or is the interpretation I laid out a valid one?","Did Walt actually think Jesse and Jack were partners in the finale, up until the point he saw Jesse?",4

This is one of the prominent caps from S4E1 ""Box Cutter"", during Victor's death, where Jesse and Gus stare at each other for a second. Here, in this screencap, Jesse transitions out of his near-catatonic state into awareness once again. Obviously, he's snarling, his face is contorted into a defiant expression -- something along the lines of ""I don't care if I die, fuck you"". Afterwards, of course, Jesse kind of fucks off and does things that are highly risky and dangerous for the beginning of S4. [And later into S4, he learns some moderation of both risk and caution, but that's later.] Interestingly enough, I find that this parallels S1 -- Walt throws himself into the criminal world merely because he decided to cut loose and sort of say ""fuck death, I'm in charge now"", and the show has been all about the consequences of that attitude since. Anyway, Jesse basically does a shorter version of that in the beginning of S4. Jokingly, I suppose you could say Jesse broke bad here (lmao). This makes sense, as S4 centers upon a sort of role reversal in status between Walt and Jesse, and so, naturally, if Jesse is supposed to take up Walt's position of power, he's going to have to parallel Walt and reflect that same recklessness. [This isn't a remark on intelligence, of course, merely a remark on the attitudes of both Jesse and Walt in regards to narrative direction.]","A short analysis of a screencap from ""Box Cutter""",7

458,LondonKush,2019-06-19 00:49:37,0,1,3," Breaking bad fan theory. So with the CIA's alleged involvement with narcotics to the theory of the it’s a common conspiracy theory that the United States government has had some involvement in the black market drug trade in America. I have this theory that from episode (S5/E12) (Soft Ball) of Malcom in the middle, Hal steals information for a job interview from a former navy seal who works in the next cubicle in his office. He argues with Lois about the morals of him stealing the interview from his colleague but Lois assures him he has children and to go to the job interview. He turns up to a plain white office building that leads to a door with (212 Global Sales Industries) he walks into a waiting room where four ominous men dressed in black suits wearing sunglasses are guarding the waiting room and a young girl in a red dress is filling out a form on a clip board on a sofas. Hal nervously walks up to her and asks “is this where” and before he can finish the girl interrupts and says “we’re not supposed to talk” Hal says sorry when he notices a slit in one of the walls which has (applicants) above it. The slit is eye level, so Hal approaches and looks into it. He asks “excuse me I..” he pauses and gazes at something in the room and says “three seconds?” Then a black sack is thrown over his head and he’s taken to a secret location. The bag is taken off to revel he’s in a office which is only lit by a table lamp where a man in a black suit is seated at a desk in front of him. The man says to Hal “ so I understand you would like to work for us” Startled Hal looks around the room frantically, trying to figure out where he is and what’s going on. Hal replies “ d,d,did someone..” and before he can finish the man says “this job is a wonderful opportunity for the right kind of person. Good pay, three weeks vacation, full benefits package plus the knowledge that you’re really making a difference.” Hal looks at him concerned and the man attempts to smile at hal. Hal rubs his hands together, still startled then suddenly an alarm goes off and gun shots can be heard from outside of the room they’re in. Hal looks back then forward then back again alarmed he asks the man “ excuse me was this..” the man immediately interrupts Hal by saying “ if you can hold off on your questions until I’m finished with mine., Number one. Do you have a photographic memory? Hal replies nervously with “I don’t think so?” He then asks “ are you allergic to venomous spider bites? Which Hal asks “how would I know that? And finally the man asks **“do you have an identical twin?”** Hal replies “no.” The man says “Ok, that’s all I have” the man leans over his desk and processed to staple a piece of paper to Hal’s tie that has the number 31 on it. Then the man says **“go next door. They’ll make a mould of your face and then we can get started”** they then proceed to put Hal through tests to measure his health and fitness heart rate etc. While a man in a lab coat is throwing something at Hal while he ducks and dodges them. The next clip is Hal upside down trying to solve a Rubix cube while fire crackers are thrown at him. The next clip is Hal on a hospital bed while alien like probes are inside his mouth ears and rectal area. Then finally a man in a black suit is seen carrying Hal outside of the building to the sidewalk. He drops Hal down and says “ Thank you for your interest sir, any feelings of paranoia over the next few days are completely normal” he removes his glasses nods at Hal places them back on and walk back into the building. Hal then sprints off down the middle of the road. For the rest of the episode Hal is extremely paranoid. Lois is having an argument with Francis and Malcom, Hal walks around nervously Louis asks him to talk to the boys but Hal says “ not now, Lois I have way too much on my mind” “like what?” She asks “I think I’m an international spy and I don’t even know which side I’m on. **I could be a super villain and not even know it.''** Fast forward into the episode Hal goes back to the office where the interview took place but the building is no longer there. It’s completely gone to Hal’s sheer disbelief. Hal nervously shouts out to the empty space “ Thank you for considering me. It’s very flattering but I’ve decided to stay where I am for now, if things change I’ll let you know!” He laughs nervously, nods and then runs away. That’s the last of the sub plot in this episode. But with all of this there is a possibility that Walt is in fact Hal’s clone and that he was a pawn in the US governments on going war with the Cartel. And that Hal’s clone was made to destroy the meth industry. And that maybe Mike was actually Walt’s minder working for CIA / the US government the entire time. In breaking bad you see Walt have a midlife crises because of his terminal cancer diagnosis which leads him to eventually become the main source of meth. He started off making batches of his own with Jesse at the start but eventually works his way up to working for Gus who had more power in the meth industry than the Mexican cartel did. With Gus’s and Don Eladio Vuente's relationship it wouldn’t have been long until the cartel wanted the same money and quality that Gus was producing and would call upon Gus for help in achieving it.  In breaking bad you see Gus and Mike kill a majority of the most powerful cartel members which scratches off big names off of the US governments cartel list. Walt wasn’t involved or present for this but depending on how his and Jesse’s relationship would of been at that time there’s a possibility he could have been present. Tuco gets killed. The brothers get killed. Hector gets killed. Gus gets killed. All big players in the meth trade and again names that would have been of huge interest for the US government. Later on Walt gets involved with  Jack Welker who is the last piece of the meth trade who's producing Blue Ice. Jack later kidnaps Jesse and uses him to cook meth. Walt figures out a plan to kill the gang and to save Jessie which he does. Jessie drives off happy for his new freedom and with what’s happened to Jessie, myself and I’m sure many others doubt he’ll be doing another cook again. Walt’s left dead on the floor with a satisfied look on his face as officers walk over his body securing the crime scene. With his death is the last of the big players in the meth industry. And like I stated before I highly doubt with what’s happened Jessie will go back to anything meth related. So could that be it? Could Walt have been some sort of cloned sleeper agent that was created to bring down some of the cartel and to destroy the meth industry within side itself? Just a thought.",Breaking bad fan theory (Hal's Clone),3

467,gstevens123,2019-06-18 16:37:32,0,4,5,"Breaking Bad was the greatest tv drama that I had watched. It was also the first. It still is my favourite, yet Better Call Saul is just as good to me. The style of both is so similar yet different. 

Obviously Vince Gilligan and the team worked on both so there’s obvious similarities, but they are in no way the same. 

The acting in both is some of the best I have seen. 

Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn, Bob Odenkirk, Dean Norris, Jonathan Banks, Giancarlo Esposito, Michael McKean, Rhea Seehorn, Michael Mando, Raymond Cruz. 

The fact that I pretty much named the entire cast for both shows and couldn’t leave anyone out is testament to the level of acting.

In relation to Skyler, both Ted and Walt are people that she's laundered money for (and fucked, but that's beside the point). People who, regardless of Skyler providing the resources for them to stop committing their respective crimes, continue to commit those crimes anyway. Walt keeps cooking meth even though Skyler gives him many incentives to stop, Ted keeps evading the IRS even though Skyler gave him the money to get them off his heels. Both decisions eventually lead to the demise and misfortune of the two men, all while Skyler plays an exasperated accomplice to them. Both men also say they are committing and hiding their crimes from their families to ""provide and protect them"". Furthermore, when Ted first receives Skyler's money, the first thing he does is go out and buy a fancy new car. This hedonism is later paralleled by Walt in S5A, where after he remakes all the money lost to Ted, he goes out and gets fancy new cars for both him and Walt Jr.",Ted and Walt are parallels,25

475,BreakingBadDude,2019-06-17 17:42:55,0,10,24,"So I had a Breaking Bad related story happen sometime around last Christmas. I was playing Trivial Pursuit with my family (modern version, 2000’s), and my dad pulls a card to ask the group of us. He reads it and quickly says “oh man, there’s no way any of you will get this. If you get this, I’ll give you each $10,000). So the stakes were pretty high. The category was Art. None of us tend to do well with the art questions, but I was curious why he was so confident. He proceeds to read the question. I don’t remember exactly what it was but it was something along these lines: “This female artist from New Mexico is known for her desert landscapes, and flower paintings.” After my dad reads it, he has this smug look on his face like “see?! Good luck with that!” And naturally, none of us should have gotten in. But being that I have watched BrBa 9 times. I obviously perked up when I heard New Mexico. Then I thought of the “paintings that look like vaginas”. Must be those New Mexico flowers. So the only guess I could think of was “Georgia O’Keefe”. I started smiling and said “I think I actually know this” and my dad laughed and said “nope, there’s no way you know this”. So deciding to try and match his confidence, I said “If I get it right, can I have the others $10,000 as well?” We were playing with my mom and my wife. So that would equal $30,000. He said “yep, if you get this right, I’ll give you $30,000”. Everyone stared in anticipation and I said my guess “It’s Georgia O’Keefe”. His face dropped, my wife and mom both looked over to him to see his reaction. The color has now left his face and he says “how did you know that?!?”. Meanwhile my wife and mom were like “what?! He’s right???”. So then I explained how I knew. I then told them that they all have to re-watch Breaking Bad again in my honor (they’ve only seen it once, the idiots).

Walt points out that Cuban cigars are illegal and how if they were drinking alcohol in 1930, they would be breaking the law. He says it’s all arbitrary which is bullshit. It’s a shameless attempt from apart of himself to try justify his own vile actions and in part to paint the man who hunts people like him,  Hank as a hypocrite. 

Walt is smart enough to know that various drugs aren't equal and they all differ immensely. He knows damn well that meth won’t ever be legal. He knows that what he’s selling is warrently illegal and a different category than weed, cigars and alcohol. He’s just putting all that to the side and taking this opportunity to vent in some type of way. The narcissist within him was saying “ hey hank those Cuban cigars are illegal, what’s the difference between you and me since I cook  meth “ 😂🙃

My cousin by marriage used to be a heroin dealer. He tried to justify his actions like walt but deep Down he knew his justifications and excuses were total bullshit. He sure admits that today. He later got addicted to his own product and he ended up spending some time in prison. He got clean and is still clean to this day. I’m proud of him. He condemns the actions of his past.

I recently started Breaking Bad after a ton of recommendations(and not enough anime) and , it's definitely one of the best shows I've ever seen. I love everything, from the soundtrack to the dark humor, to the foreshadowing. But one thing that really makes me confused is Walter and how he reacts to things.

Like, near the middle of the episode he begins ranting to Saul about how his son made a charity website for him and how he has enough money already. But my thing is, why is he so worked up about it? Even if he has a ton of money his son's doing something nice for him and it seems weird. I get that he hates charity but is there any reason for him to make as big a deal out of it as he does in the episode?

I remember this scene pretty well. After Jesse is done cooking meth with Walt, sometime in the first few seasons he dresses up in a suit and goes to a corporate building or something for a job interview. 

The guy interviewing Jesse is older with white hair, and he tells him that if he is chosen for the job, he will be hired in advertising.

Then, as a demonstration, the white-haired guy pulls open the blinds to show Badger dancing around in a costume holding an advertisement for that company, which is clearly a lower ranked job than what Jesse was expecting. Jesse is in a state of disbelief and immediately storms out. I remember this because I thought it was hilarious and kinda tragic at the same time.

Remember in season 4 when Walter tried to arrange for The Escape of his family, he was in the crawl space and learned that Skyler had given the money to Ted. What ensued was one of the most iconic scenes in the series, Walter laughing / crying maniacally. This moment is often interpreted as the spiritual death of Walter White.

In Jesse's final scene, he is behind the wheel of the truck, trying to make the escape that Walter couldn't, and we see him laughing / crying maniacally in a way that is unmistakably similar to Walter earlier in the series. This could mean that Jesse is spiritually dead.  Could this be the theme of Jesse's movie?

I finished the series a few hours ago, I asked 2/3 questions and I wanted your opinion:

Do you, too, in the end prefer Jesse to WW / Heisenberg?

What happens to Jesse has disgusted me with WW on the last seasons (not the first ones), but on the one hand, it's a little ironic to the series, right? He would not be here if he did not ""believe"" that WW was trapping him with the bald and naughty scene on the square (at one point in the WW series he even says that Jesse is harming him more than to others), but on the other hand, WW put a contract on his head, it's a bit of everything going on throughout the series, he gets into trouble both, but WW does its best to save Jesse every time

He knew his only way out was to cut off all the ties he had and clean up the loose ends before he dies, and he did it. I wanted to him to succeed because ultimately he did have love in his heart, he was just too stupid and self centered to admit it. His character arc was perfect.

As said earlier on the episode, people need to be in that sideways fetal position, in case they want to puke, so that they don't choke on their own puke.

Well, what I thought of this scene when I first watched it, is that Walter went there and the girl next to Jessie, happened to be laying flat and happened to want to puke, which lead to her death, that Walter White could have prevented, but instead left nature take it's course.

However, upon rewatching it today, I just realised, that they were both in a spoon position, until Walter White, shoved and pushed Jessie around, which caused his Girlfriend to fall back and lay flat, which then followed by her puking and chocking to death.

676,[deleted],2019-06-08 04:59:16,0,16,34,"IF YOU HAVEN’T WATCHED THE SHOW YET, DO NOT READ THIS! (Probably unnecessary for this sub but just in case)

Damn. What an amazing show. Seriously, all the characters feel so organic and natural, like, I was constantly questioning whether or not I should feel bad for Walt or be angry that he was lying to everyone and making Jesse feel like shit. 

Even every other character sort of feels that way to some extent, like Skyler. When she cheated on Walt I was kind of pissed, but at the same time I was like well damn, Walt’s been pretty shitty to her this entire time, I guess her actions were kind of justified. The whole show is just so well written, holy fuck.

I cried multiple times throughout the show and was constantly rooting for people, even the so-called villains at times. Like when the snipers were at Gus’s HQ and then he just walked out into the gunfire like a fucking bad ass, that shit had me going crazy. 

But the reason I wanted to make this post is because of what Jesse went through the entire show. Looking back, he lost everything he loved. Like, *everything*. First his parents rejected him when he tried to come back, then Jane died (in a really fucked up way), then Kombo died, then Gale, then Andrea. But what got me the most was the finale, when he drove off and cried his fucking ass off, yelling at the top of his lungs. I didn’t really understand why he was crying at first, but then when it transitioned to Walt walking into the meth lab and then dying, it hit me like a ton of bricks. 

He lost everything he loved, and to top everything off, he lost his partner, his mentor, his (once) best friend (I guess they never really became *that* close but idk). Like god damn, I just felt all of his pain at once and started crying, Jesus. It was so fucking depressing to finally realize that things never went right for him and he practically lost everything that ever meant something to him. 

Anyways this post kind of turned into a rant and I just wanted to say how I felt about the show, so yeah, sorry if these kinds of posts are super common. Also, I MAY just be looking a little too much into it. Maybe. Lol

He stops up the road before returning home, suspecting that someone might be waiting for him. He calls his neighbour to check if he has left the stove/oven on. Neighbour enters the house, the intruders bail and neighbour goes home.

Here is the thing. Walt's kitchen is full of DIY explosive making material, he cleans it up when he gets home. Wouldn't the neighbour have seen all this shit? Raised some suspicion?

Anyway, thoughts? Am I misinterpreting the situation or is this a plot hole?

I fricken loved the show, best I've ever watched. I think I've seen it start to finish 4 or 5 times. But this bugs me.

Edit: actually think it was the second last season. But the rest is correct.","Final season, when Walt returns home...",12
747,TimmyKirk224,2019-06-05 20:24:04,0,3,0,"Just finished my rewatch of 5b and I can safely say that it is the only season that improves on rewatch. The pacing, story, richness of the dialogue, it all comes together like an earth- shattering novel. If it wasn't for that plane crash it would be a contender for one of the best seasons of television ever. The other seasons, while mildly enjoyable, seemed overly cartoony and the the plot devices and cliffhangers became laughable. Also Walt jr was a horrible character and it became apparent in s3 onwards. Still a good show and an all-time fave.

Thoughts? Agree/Disagree?",Season 2 is unquestionably far and away the best.,0
